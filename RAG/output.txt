Several laboratory tests can make the diagnosis of infection
Predicted Answer: A: The description in this question is most consistent with sepsis due to Neisseria meningitidis infection. Phenol testing of blood at 90°C will result in a positive test if the blood contains certain endotoxins. When the blood from a patient with N. meningitidis sepsis is exposed to phenol, it can undergo thermal instability, which then prompts the release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) subunits from the bacterial cell wall into the bloodstream. The presence of LPS is what leads to the endotoxin-driven reaction that ultimately manifests in the clinical symptoms and laboratory findings listed here.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient has symptoms suggestive of vernal conjunctivitis. Treatment for vernal conjunctivitis includes mast cell stabilizers and topical corticosteroids, but a short course of corticosteroid eye drops is usually sufficient. Erythromycin ointment (choice A) is used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis or blepharitis. Warm compresses (choice C) can help with chronic inflammation in conditions such as plepharitis or demodex infestation but are not helpful for vernal conjunctivitis. Fluorometholone eye drops (choice D) is a corticosteroid that can be used to treat inflammatory eye disorders, including uveitis and Fuchs' simplex epitheliopathy, but it has anti-inflammatory effects that may be more than needed for this patient's condition.

Predicted Answer: A: The patient has onycholysis, where her nails are separating from their beds. Pitting of the fingernails is associated with psoriasis (choice A). This chronic inflammatory condition also causes silvery plaques on extensor surfaces such as elbows and knees. In addition to cutaneous manifestations, patients may develop erosions of the dental enamel ("nail" pitting) and joint inflammation (arthritis), which can lead to a holosystolic murmur due to mitral valve dysfunction. Choice B is incorrect because the lesions described are those of psoriasis, not lichen sclerosis. This condition also occurs in girls but causes pruritic erythematous papules with an annular configuration that may leave hyperpigmentation. Lichen sclerosis (also known as balanitis xerotica obliterans) causes white patches that can be found on the skin and mucous membranes of affected individuals, including a flesh-colored papule in the lumbosacral region. Choice C is incorrect because pitting of the nails is associated with psoriasis, not lichen planus (LP).

3. A transient systolic murmur due to tricuspid regurgitation
Predicted Answer: A: If a patient moves from a supine to a standing position, he will experience a shift of blood away from the lower extremities toward the head and upper extremities due to gravity, resulting in an increase in right atrial pressure as blood accumulates in the thoracic cavity. This maneuver does not directly affect pulmonary capillary wedge (PCW) pressure since PCW is primarily determined by left ventricular end-diastolic volume. The slope of the pacemaker potential would be reduced only if the patient experienced a decrease in intracellular Ca2+ levels within cardiac cells, as occurs with hypocalcemia or certain anesthetic agents. Finally, diastolic filling time would not change in this scenario since it is primarily determined by heart rate and contractility rather than by posture. (Choice B) PCW pressure is the same as left atrial pressure when there are no gradients across the mitral valve. The slope of the pacemaker potential refers to the slope of phase 4 depolarization, which would be increased in hypocalcemia.

Infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), also known as human herpesvirus 4, leads to infectious mononucleosis, but chronic infection has been associated with an increased risk for development of NHL, including the diffuse large B cell variant. Individuals infected with EBV are more likely to have visited Africa and thus be exposed to malaria, which facilitates transmission of EBV.

Predicted Answer: A) The child has signs of status asthmaticus and severe asthma exacerbation requiring mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure, which is a life-threatening condition. Intravenous magnesium sulfate was given as an adjunctive treatment to albuterol nebulization in the management of this patient. However, there are specific situations where patients with asthma can present in shock after receiving albuterol treatment. The most important clue regarding this child's presentation lies in the clinical improvement that occurred immediately after he received magnesium sulfate. Magnesium is a bronchodilator and also has an inotropic effect on the heart. Therefore, a patient who presents in shock (low blood pressure) with severe asthma exacerbation may benefit from intravenous magnesium because it can help to improve cardiac contractility and vascular tone. In this case, after administration of magnesium sulfate, the child's vital signs improved significantly, including blood pressure (normalized), pulse rate decreased, and respirations decreased as well. Therefore, there is no need to mechanically ventilate him (option A). The patient does not have a pneumothorax because no crackles or rubs are heard on physical examination of chest in addition to the absence of any abnormalities in lung fields following administration of albuterol nebulization with ipratropium bromide. Hence, performing needle thoracostomy would be inappropriate (option B). The clinical improvement that occurred after magnesium sulfate was given indicates that it is working well and there is no need for bronchoscopy (option C) or additional dose of methylprednisolone (option D).

Predicted Answer: A) This patient is a primigravid female at 35 weeks' gestation with no prior serious medical illness who presents in labor without fetal heartbeats detectable by the fetal doppler monitor. Ultrasound shows decreased amniotic fluid levels and no evidence of fetal movement, respiration, or heart activity. The infant weighs 2296 g (5 lb 1 oz) at birth and has no visible malformations. Given that there was a normal ultrasound performed at 22 weeks' gestation, this scenario may represent an in utero demise of the fetus likely due to a placental abruption. A karyotype on the amniotic fluid is not needed because the fetus's death occurred after the amniocentesis (obtained at 15-18 weeks), and it is highly unlikely that the fetus would have died without any other signs or symptoms of distress in utero. Photographs, x-ray imaging, and MRI may be useful in determining the cause of death but are not a priority given the clinical presentation. Obtaining consent for parental genetic testing is also not needed in this case because there was no indication that the fetus had an underlying genetic disorder, which would have been identified by the prior normal ultrasound at 22 weeks' gestation. Thus, the most appropriate step in management of this scenario is a postmortem examination to determine the cause of fetal demise and placental abruption.

Agranulocytosis is a potentially life-threatening decrease in granulocytes, especially neutrophils. Typically, it manifests as fever, fatigue, sore throat, or the presence of an infection (such as pneumonia). The mechanism behind this reaction isn't well understood, but it may be related to the drug's ability to inhibit dopamine D2 receptors and increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. Other side effects associated with risperidone include orthostatic hypotension, sedation, dizziness, somnolence, nausea, constipation, tremor, anxiety, and QT prolongation. (This makes B incorrect.)

The most appropriate medication for this patient would be nystatin, which disrupts cell membrane permeability. Nystatin works by binding to sterols in the fungal cell membrane, thus disrupting its function, leading to the death of the organism. Choices B and C are incorrect because they refer to the antifungal medications amphotericin B (which inhibits microtubule formation) and ketoconazole (which inhibits 14-alpha-demethylase), respectively. Choice D is also incorrect as it refers to the mechanism of action of echinocandins, such as caspofungin, which inhibit beta-glucan synthase.

Note: Candida albicans is a fungus that can cause yeast infections in various parts of the body including the mouth and vagina. It has also been implicated in systemic candidiasis, an invasive fungal infection that can occur in immunocompromised hosts such as patients with HIV/AIDS or who are on chemotherapy and have neutropenia.

Predicted Answer: A: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of schistosomiasis, which is caused by Schistosoma species of flatworms. These worms have a complex life cycle involving freshwater snails as an intermediate host and humans (and other mammals) as the final host. Infection with these organisms leads to chronic inflammation in organs such as the liver, intestines, and urinary bladder. Eggs laid by the female worm can cause tissue damage in the affected organ. The presence of eggs with lateral spines in the stool culture is consistent with schistosomiasis. This organism can also be associated with a leukocytosis (increased number of white blood cells) that contains eosinophils, granulomatous inflammation, and periportal fibrosis in organs such as the liver. The exposure most likely to have played a role in the development of this patient's symptoms was her exposure to freshwater snails while in Uganda.

Predicted Answer: A: The patient has developed a case of recurrent gonorrhea. Gonorrhea is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and is known for lacking lasting immunity; 75% of patients do not have protective antibodies against the next infection even if they were previously infected. This lack of lasting immunity is due to the ability of N. gonorrhoeae to change its surface pili protein. This variation in antigen makes it difficult for the body to develop a lasting immune response, and thus the patient will likely be susceptible again after the initial course of treatment has resolved. (A) is correct because pili proteins are involved with adhesion of organisms to surfaces. They can vary due to their antigenic nature. The exotoxins released from bacteria generally refer to toxins that act outside the host cell; these toxins can cause systemic effects such as diarrhea, fever, and vomiting.

Predicted Answer: A: The patient described has Parkinson’s disease; amantadine is a dopamine agonist that is often used in its treatment. Amantadine can also be used as an antiviral drug and would be appropriate if the patient had influenza or was at risk for HIV infection, so it seems to fit this case perfectly. Ribavirin, choice B, is used against viral infections such as RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) or hepatitis C. Levodopa, choice C, also a dopamine agonist, would be used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease but not to alleviate symptoms of influenza. Zidovudine, choice D, an antiretroviral drug used against HIV infection, is incorrect because there are no clinical manifestations of this viral infection.

Predicted Answer: A: Magnesium toxicity can cause absent deep tendon reflexes, as well as other neurologic symptoms such as confusion and slurred speech. It is treated by administering calcium gluconate because it will help block the effects of magnesium at neuromuscular junctions. Labetalol may be given to reduce blood pressure but does not have any significant side effect profile that would lead us away from using it in this case, so choice B is incorrect. Lorazepam can also be used to calm patients who are agitated due to their pain or discomfort; however, the patient's deep tendon reflexes will return if the magnesium toxicity is treated with calcium gluconate, and there may be some residual sedation effect from lorazepam that we might not want in this case. Therefore, choice C is incorrect. Nerve conduction studies are diagnostic tests that would help identify nerve damage but do not play a role in treating absent deep tendon reflexes due to magnesium toxicity.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient has Klinefelter syndrome, characterized by hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and azoospermia. The genetic abnormality associated with this condition is XXY, as the testes have extra X chromosomes. If the error occurred in spermatogenesis at any point after the sex chromatin determination (i.e., meiosis), it would be expected to be a Y chromosome loss, resulting in 45,X cells. This is seen in patients with Klinefelter syndrome as well as other non-disjunction errors such as Turner syndrome (45,X). The presence of XY cells would indicate that the error occurred at the spermatogonium stage; thus, A is incorrect. Since the patient's testes have only XX cells, the error must occur after the sex chromatin determination in meiosis, so B, C, and D are also incorrect.

Predicted Answer: A: The most likely diagnosis for this patient is slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), which is a disorder that occurs during adolescent growth spurts where the proximal portion of the femur fails to undergo normal apophyseal development and begins to slip posteriorly, causing pain in the affected limb. SCFE has a predilection for obese prepubescent males. The best initial management for this condition is casting or crutch ambulation to immobilize the hip and prevent further slippage. A Pavlik harness may be used in infants with developmental dysplasia of the hip; however, it would not be appropriate in this patient due to his age. Supportive therapy alone without immobilization could lead to further slippage of the femoral head. Surgical pinning is typically considered as a secondary procedure when conservative management has failed and further slippage of the femur is noted on imaging studies.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient's presentation is most consistent with carcinoid syndrome, a condition caused by an excess of serotonin, often resulting from metastatic carcinoids tumors in the liver of patients with neuroendocrine cancer. The mucoid strings are due to the presence of secretin and other hormonal products. These secretions inhibit peristalsis (resulting in bloating and crampy pain) and stimulate pancreatic secretion (resulting in diarrhea). The excess serotonin also increases gut blood flow, resulting in the patient's weight loss. His rash may have been a cutaneous manifestation of the syndrome. This condition is associated with elevated levels of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), which causes vasodilation, increased gut blood flow, and diarrhea.

Explanation: This question requires a basic knowledge of pharmacology and biochemistry as they pertain to the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient has low hemoglobin levels, low reticulocyte count (indicating bone marrow failure), high ferritin level (iron overload), and normal mean corpuscular volume (indicative of normocytic anemia). These findings suggest the patient has anemia associated with CKD. Erythropoietin is deficient in patients with CKD and stimulates erythropoiesis by activating the JAK/STAT pathway through erythropoietin receptors on the surface of bone marrow cells. However, the mechanism for this pathway does not directly involve PI3K/Akt/mTOR (A). The MAP kinase pathway is involved with cell proliferation, but it is not the correct choice in this case either (B). Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) releases calcium ions from intracellular stores and has no role in erythropoiesis (D). Thus, the best answer is C.

Predicted Answer: A)  Torsades de pointes are a specific type of polymorphic VT that can occur in patients who have prolonged QT intervals on an ECG. This patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort may indicate hypomagnesemia or hypokalemia (both of which would be expected after surgery, given the patient is taking only a multivitamin supplement). Hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia can cause prolongation of the QT interval. This patient's symptoms of numbness around his mouth and spasms in his hand suggest hypocalcemia as well. Hypocalcemia, along with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, is expected to result in a prolonged QT interval, which could lead to torsades de pointes. B, C, and D are all possible ECG findings after cardiac surgery but not the most likely finding for this patient.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) secondary to IgA nephropathy, and as such is at risk for developing CKD-MBD, which can include changes in calcium and phosphate homeostasis. The hallmark of this disorder is the inability of the kidneys to activate vitamin D, leading to hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and decreased calcitriol levels (A).

Predicted Answer: A
Explanation:
The correct answer is A. This question requires the application of scientific evidence evaluation skills to understand how the immune system responds to a specific type of infection.
Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is a bacterial disease that can cause severe blistering skin lesions in children, and it is caused by exotoxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus. The key concept here is understanding the immune response against bacterial toxins. In this case, IgG plays a primary role.
While there are several types of immunoglobulins, only one type, specifically IgG, is relevant to the correct answer in this question. Therefore, options B and C can be eliminated because they refer to different types of antibodies: IgD and IgA, respectively.
Option D also should not be chosen since it refers to another immunoglobulin (IgM) that is not directly involved with an immune response against bacterial toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus. The correct answer, A, involves the proper antibody in this scenario.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient's rash is coxsackie A virus-induced herpetic dermatitis, most likely caused by viral reactivation in dorsal root ganglia. The history of recurrent back pain with a burning sensation and the specific rash are key clues to this diagnosis. Coxsackie viruses can cause oral and skin lesions as well as systemic disease. This patient's presentation is consistent with herpes zoster, or shingles, which occurs when latent coxsackievirus reactivates in dorsal root ganglia.

Predicted Answer: A: The survival rate includes patients who are still alive and receiving treatment for their cancer, which might introduce bias in terms of treatment status when comparing outcomes between screened and unscreened populations. Use mortality rates instead of survival rates to avoid the potential bias of treatment status on observed outcomes.

If you chose B, you need to remember that mortality rates assume that death will occur eventually; however, survival rates can be influenced by factors such as quality of care and access to ongoing medical treatment. This would not necessarily introduce bias in conclusions but might give an overly optimistic view of the effectiveness of screening.

If you selected C or D, you need to understand the goal is to prevent confounding from differences in screened versus unscreened populations rather than increasing or decreasing sample sizes; therefore, both are incorrect.

125.4.2 Blood Count
Predicted Answer: A: The patient in this question had a history of hematuria and proteinuria along with a sore throat that resolved without treatment, which likely represented a poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) infection. Formation of antigen-antibody complexes is the most likely mechanism involved in PSGN. The elevated antistreptolysin O titer is also consistent with this diagnosis, as it indicates that the patient had been exposed to Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus and mounted a specific immune response against it. Therefore, answer C is correct. Answer A is incorrect because IgE binding to mast cells is more relevant in allergic conditions such as anaphylaxis or atopic reactions (i.e., asthma, hay fever). The antibodies formed in PSGN are not tissue-specific; thus, answer B is also incorrect. Although the T-cells involved in cell-mediated immunity can be presensitized and cytotoxic, this mechanism does not involve the formation of antigen-antibody complexes or the symptoms described in the patient, making answer D incorrect.

A further diagnostic evaluation under the supervisionof a pediatric endocrinologist may need an ACTH test
Predicted Answer: A: The stimulation test measures the response of the adrenal glands to ACTH and is used to evaluate the integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In patients with Addison's disease, for example, serum levels of ACTH are increased (choice A). The metyrapone test measures the suppression of cortisol production in response to exogenous glucocorticoids. Patients with Cushing's syndrome would have an increase in urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids and a decrease in serum 11-deoxycortisol, as they overproduce corticosteroids (choices B and C). This patient has symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, but her metyrapone stimulation test is normal. Therefore, she does not have adrenal insufficiency and thus the administration of metyrapone would be expected to result in an increase in serum cortisol (choice D), as this reflects a normally functioning hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

Predicted Answer: (D) The endpoint in this question is survival time.

This phenomenon is known as lead-time bias. Lead-time bias occurs when there appears to be an improvement in outcomes due to an earlier detection of disease, whereas there really has not been any change in patient survival or quality of life. It would have been incorrect to answer D if the endpoint had been mortality rate rather than survival time.

If clomiphene were administered continuously for several weeks, a condition such as diabetes may also be treated with this drug. Clomiphene has been used to lower serum glucose in type II diabetic patients and possibly to improve insulin resistance, thereby lowering blood sugar levels.

Cryotherapy ablation would not be an appropriate management plan for this particular level of neoplasia as the extent of the lesion may not warrant that degree of intervention.

Predicted Answer: A) The microscopic analysis of the patient's urine did not show casts or dysmorphic RBCs, which makes conditions like glomerulonephritis less likely and suggests a lower urinary tract source for her hematuria. Her symptoms include flank pain, costovertebral tenderness to percussion (which indicates discomfort in the flanks or kidneys), proteinuria, and hematuria with no casts seen in the urine. These findings are typical of analgesic nephropathy or acute interstitial nephritis. Choice A is correct because tubular lumen obstruction by protein casts would be consistent with analgesic nephropathy (kidney damage caused by long-term use of analgesics). Analgesic nephropathy typically affects patients who have been taking NSAIDs and/or other analgesics for years, resulting in flank pain and hematuria. Other options can be eliminated: B is incorrect because the urine studies do not show dysmorphic RBCs. C is incorrect because pyelonephritis would cause a WBC count > 10/hpf (a result that was not observed). D is incorrect because vasoconstriction of the medullary vessels could cause hematuria in conjunction with acute tubular necrosis; however, ATN would also be associated with some degree of azotemia.

Retrieved Content: skin lesions is essential for a reliable description ofdermatoses (Table 148.3).
Predicted Answer: A: The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis and the primary location where the wheals would develop due to allergic reactions like urticaria. These wheals are composed of edema fluid within the dermal papillae, which would be visible upon biopsy. (See Figure 7-25.) The stratum granulosum (B) is not a critical area for urticarial wheal formation. Histamine causes increased permeability of postcapillary venules and the release of histamine-induced factors that promote edema fluid accumulation, but this process primarily occurs in the dermis rather than the epidermis. The dermal layer (D), therefore, is not the correct answer either. The stratum basale (C) contains cells called melanocytes, which produce pigment for skin color; wheals form in the papillary layer of the dermis. Therefore, choice C is incorrect.

Predicted Answer: A: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants born to mothers who received antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy receive a single dose of zidovudine given within 12 hours of birth as part of the general prophylaxis for HIV exposure. This approach is based on the observation that perinatal transmission of HIV rarely occurs in infants whose mothers have viral loads <1,000 copies/mL when they deliver. Although HIV DNA testing will eventually be positive in infected newborns, this result typically does not occur until 2-3 weeks after birth. Since the results of both HIV RNA and HIV DNA tests are usually available within a day or two, these are less appropriate choices at present, although they will become more relevant if the infant's zidovudine suppression fails. Thus, (A) is correct. This baby was exposed to HIV through delivery from an infected mother; he should be tested in 18 days for HIV DNA, making (B) wrong. Since his mother received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy and her viral load is <1,000 copies/mL when she delivers him, the risk of perinatal transmission is negligible, which makes (C) incorrect. Although follow-up is always important, it does not make this infant's testing more immediate than any of the other choices, making (D) wrong.

Predicted Answer: A: The patient's symptoms are consistent with primary dysmenorrhea. This condition is caused by endometrial sloughing and uterine contractions mediated by prostaglandin. Endometriosis is a common cause of secondary dysmenorrhea in which menstrual flow is not the cause but rather relief from pain is delayed until menstruation ends. The patient's use of ibuprofen, which blocks prostaglandins, supports this diagnosis. In contrast, ovarian cysts (choice C) and uterine fibroids (choice D) are causes of dysmenorrhea, but these conditions usually cause an increase in the size of the uterus or ovary that is not seen in this patient. PID (choice B), which involves pelvic inflammatory disease, might be a consideration if her symptoms had been severe enough to cause a fever, elevated white count, and other physical findings; however, these are not present, making choice A more appropriate.

Predicted Answer: A: The patient most likely has leprosy. Leprosy is caused by Mycobacterium leprae, which is an acid-fast bacterium. It also tends to produce nerve damage and cause lesions on the skin that are thickened. A biopsy of such a lesion would contain acid-fast bacteria. (Note that M leprae does not grow in cultures.) Thus, the correct answer is (A). Leprosy often presents with lesions like those seen in the image. Image 19. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which causes TB, is also an acid-fast bacterium, but it causes a different disease. It produces lesions primarily within the lungs and has systemic effects on the body. The patient would likely present differently than this individual who has leprosy. Leprosy often presents as shown in the image; lepromatous leprosy is characterized by skin thickening and nerve damage and is more common among children. The bacteria that cause TB typically lodge within an organ, such as the lung or a bone, and may also infect other organs of the body. Thus, (B) and (C) are incorrect. This organism would not be described with the term "tennis-racket shaped," so (D) is also correct out.

Predicted Answer: A) The findings on this patient's physical examination are highly suggestive of a hydrocele-a fluid-filled sac that occurs between the layers of tissue covering the testicles and which transilluminates. The fact that the mass is soft, cystic, nontender, and transilluminates make this condition likely. A patent processus vaginalis (A) would be associated with an indirect inguinal hernia where bowel sounds are heard on coughing, thus making this option unlikely. Dilation of the pampiniform plexus (B) is suggestive of varicocele which is typically painful and does not transilluminate. A twisted spermatic cord (C), or "testicular twist," would be extremely painful and likely associated with an inability to palpate normal tissue above the mass, in addition to possible loss of the testicle if it was a "twisted" testicular torsion. Thus options B and C are incorrect. D) A hydrocele is caused by fluid accumulating between the layers of tissue covering the testicles (hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis), which transilluminate when illuminated with an ultraviolet light source.

This will facilitate the removal of the infected bone segment, allowing for a more favorable environment for healing to occur. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because negative pressure wound management would be inappropriate in this scenario given the presence of dead tissue that requires debridement.

Predicted Answer: A: The child has a disorder of amino acid metabolism. The most common disorder associated with hyperphenylalaninemia is PKU (see question 1), which can be treated by dietary restriction of phenylalanine. This patient's inability to decrease his phenylalanine concentration and the presence of generalized hypotonia, blue eyes, pale skin, blonde hair, and markedly elevated serum prolactin levels should prompt consideration of a related but distinct disorder: DYT (Dopa-responsive dystonia). In this condition, deficiency of dihydropteridine reductase leads to the inability of phenylalanine-derived neurotransmitters to be properly catabolized. These patients have normal PKU screening tests because they can adequately convert phenylalanine to tyrosine but cannot then inactivate dopamine, which causes dystonia and hypotonia, as well as hyperprolactinemia. Deficiency of this enzyme is usually due to mutations involving tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) supplementation has been used with great success in these patients because BH4 acts as a cofactor for dihydropteridine reductase.

Predicted Answer: A
Explanation: The patient is unable to understand the whispered sentence and has a decreased air conduction compared to bone conduction. These findings point to a sensorineural hearing loss, which involves damage to the cochlea. This type of hearing impairment typically cannot be corrected with hearing aids or surgery; however, patients may choose to use them if they find improvement in their ability to hear. (Note: The patient could also have a conductive hearing loss, where air conduction is less than bone conduction, which is due to middle ear disease.) Choices A and B are both parts of the ossicles within the middle ear, and choice C is another part of this system as well. Choice D is a structure that would be associated with sensorineural hearing loss. The correct answer is (D).

Retrieved Content: The diagnosis of meningitis depends on lumbar puncture
for examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (cell count, chem-istry and cultures). Imaging techniques (ultrasonography,magnetic resonance imaging) are mainly useful for prognosisor to establish whether there are complications.
Predicted Answer: A: This patient has symptoms and signs of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The findings listed in this question include internuclear ophthalmoplegia, hyperreflexia, clonus, and bladder dysfunction, among others. These are all common presenting complaints associated with MS. The MRI study also most likely would show lesions characteristic of multiple sclerosis. Therefore, if a lumbar puncture is performed on this patient, the cerebrospinal fluid analysis will be consistent with an inflammatory demyelinating disease process (MS). In patients suspected of having multiple sclerosis, there are several tests that can confirm or exclude the diagnosis. Cerebrospinal fluid electrophoresis can demonstrate oligoclonal IgG bands. Normally, patients with multiple sclerosis do not have oligoclonal bands in their CSF because it is not able to pass through the intact blood-brain barrier (BBB). Oligoclonal bands are found only within the CNS and are present in 90% of patients with MS. Therefore, if no bands are found on CSF electrophoresis, this can help exclude a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Thus, choice C is correct. Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because they are associated with viral infections, bacterial meningitis, and subacute combined degeneration, respectively, all of which would not be consistent with the clinical findings described in this question.

Predicted Answer: A: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of pancreatic cancer. Although no single test can confirm the diagnosis with certainty, an abdominal CT scan would be the most appropriate next step because it is the best test for identifying a pancreatic tumor. The CT scan could also provide information regarding tumor size and possible metastasis to adjacent organs or lymph nodes. It may also identify other causes of the patient's symptoms such as other tumors, chronic pancreatitis, or liver disease.

The question in this item requires the test-taker to synthesize the clinical data provided and make a rational decision about which diagnostic test would be most appropriate next step. The test-taker must understand that the combination of abdominal bloating, foul-smelling stools, and weight loss are symptoms suggestive of pancreatic cancer, and an abdominal CT scan is the best way to confirm this diagnosis.

Explanation
The local release of adenosine has been shown to increase coronary blood flow during exercise through vasodilation. The exact mechanisms for this phenomenon are not fully understood but may involve the interaction between adenosine and its receptor, A2a. Adenosine has no role in causing chest pain; however, in some individuals (such as those who have experienced a myocardial infarction), adenosine is released during stress testing to cause vasodilation of the coronary arteries and potentially terminate the test if an ischemic pattern develops.

Predicted Answer: A: The p-value of 0.052 indicates a statistically insignificant result. Choice A misrepresents the meaning of a p-value. If there were 100 studies and this one was similar enough that it came out the same way as the others 5.2% of the time, then its p-value would have to be equal to 0.052. However, you must consider all 100 experiments and what p-values they had. The study in question would need a p-value greater than 0.052 (because it is less likely than the other results) for this choice to be correct. Choice B misrepresents what it means for a result to be statistically significant (answer D). If you were going to test the hypothesis that statin A is more effective, then B would be true. However, because we are testing that statin A is less effective, you must reverse the statement and its truth value in answer B. That results in an incorrect choice since you are looking for a 4.8% chance of the opposite happening (of it being due to chance) rather than a 5.2% chance of the hypothesis being true. Choice C misrepresents the meaning of the p-value. If there were a 94.8% chance that statin A was more effective, then there would be a 5.2% chance that B is more effective, and since this is not what we are looking for, you can eliminate answer C.

Predicted Answer: A: The patient presented with signs of Wernicke's encephalopathy (hepatolenticular degeneration) and Korsakoff syndrome; he is presumed alcoholic based on his social status. Thiamine administration would help reverse the altered mental status and hand tremor seen in this patient, but the gastrointestinal complaints are more consistent with lactulose therapy, a disaccharide used to treat hepatic encephalopathy, which often presents similarly. The development of diarrhea and flatulence after hospital admission is a clue that the appropriate investigation for this patient's altered mental status included a measurement of his ammonia levels; high levels would be consistent with liver dysfunction (e.g., cirrhosis) leading to the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy, which can be treated with lactulose. Thiamine would not have caused the diarrhea and flatulence seen in this patient. Naloxone is a medication that blocks opioid receptors; it would not cause gastrointestinal side effects like diarrhea or would not correct an alteration in mental status. Rifaximin is an antibiotic used to treat travelers' diarrhea, and this does not fit the symptoms of this patient.

However, this patient also has a renal biopsy showing large eosinophilic casts. This would be more consistent with a diagnosis of light chain disease (or lambda or kappa chain disease) which is seen in the context of multiple myeloma. Light chain disease can cause a variety of manifestations including damage to the kidneys (known as "myeloma kidney") where the abnormal monoclonal protein is excreted and accumulates in the kidneys and causes damage. Hemolysis due to mechanical destruction of red cells by fibrin strands (also known as schistocytes) is seen in conditions that lead to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, which can be seen in myeloma kidney among other conditions. The presence of schistocytes on a peripheral smear would indicate active microangiopathic hemolysis and thus is consistent with the patient's findings.

Predicted Answer: A: The clinical scenario described in this question is a classic presentation of an ovarian rupture. An ultrasound will typically show free fluid within the rectouterine pouch (also known as the cul-de-sac) if there is indeed a ruptured ovarian cyst. A ruptured ovarian cyst can lead to significant blood loss, which is most likely to collect in the rectouterine pouch. Therefore, choice A is correct. Choice B is incorrect because blood would more likely accumulate between the liver and kidney. Choice C is incorrect because blood from an ovarian rupture would be unlikely to travel all the way around the spleen and kidneys. Choice D is incorrect because free fluid within the rectovesical pouch would suggest a ureteral injury rather than an ovarian cyst rupture.

Alternative strategies include prenatal surveil-lance in Tg-Ig negative pregnant women and prophylaxis offetal
Predicted Answer: A: While all of these screening tests may be valuable in certain patients, they are not required for pregnancy screening unless indicated by patient risk factors. Hepatitis A is not a bloodborne infection and therefore does not need to be screened for unless specifically indicated in the patient's history. Hepatitis C, N. gonorrhea, and C. trachomatis are all STIs that should only be tested for in patients at high risk (e.g., those with multiple sexual partners or who have a history of STDs). HIV screening is recommended once during pregnancy as part of routine prenatal care to identify patients who may benefit from antiretroviral therapy. Syphilis testing is also recommended, although it can likely be done using nontreponemal tests such as the VDRL and RPR in addition to treponemal tests such as the FTA-ABS and TPPA (the specific test choice will depend on the patient's serologic response). Hepatitis B is a bloodborne pathogen that does not require screening unless the patient has a history of blood transfusions or needle sharing, though vaccination against this virus should be offered to all patients. Therefore, while screening for HIV and syphilis are recommended for all pregnant women, other STIs (hepatitis A is actually an enteric pathogen) do not need to be screened unless the patient's specific risk factors warrant such testing. The correct answer is therefore (A).

Predicted Answer: (B)  The symptoms described in this case are typical of paranoid personality disorder (PPD), which is part of Cluster A in DSM-IV-TR. One must always look for characteristic patterns of thought and behavior when a patient presents with a complaint that cannot be explained by a primary diagnosis. Individuals with PPD are suspicious, distrust others, and tend to overestimate their abilities. They are often perceived as being rigid and critical. If the symptoms described in this case could belong to another personality disorder, it would be paranoid personality disorder’s "cluster cousin," the passive-aggressive or negativistic personality disorder. The symptoms of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder would not match those described. Individuals with that disorder tend to be overly anxious about orderliness and perfectionism. Antisocial personality disorder (also called psychopathic personality) is a cluster B disorder characterized by aggressive, manipulative, and unemotional behavior toward others. Schizotypal personality disorder, choice A, is another Cluster A disorder characterized by odd behavior, eccentricities, or social withdrawal. However, it does not include suspicion of being persecuted as in the case described. (D)  would be an incorrect answer if no other diagnosis fits a cluster pattern. (Knowledge level II)

Predicted Answer: A: The arterial blood gas indicates a metabolic acidosis. This patient’s history of polysubstance abuse makes it difficult to determine what drug is most likely causing his presentation. However, there are some clues that can point us in the right direction. Polysubstance abusers often also have psychiatric problems such as depression or schizophrenia. Given this patient’s psychiatric history and his head CT results, we should consider a drug that could cause acidosis without being directly cardiotoxic. The correct answer is A: Amitriptyline. Amitriptyline overdose can lead to severe metabolic acidosis and is more likely to be found in someone with psychiatric problems.

Predicted Answer: A: The diagram provided is a Darrow-Yannet diagram that plots total body fluid volume and osmolality. In this patient with diarrhea and vomiting, it appears that there is significant dehydration leading to decreased blood volume (green dotted line indicating hypovolemia). This suggests that this patient will likely have an increase in secretion of substances aimed at increasing water reabsorption, such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) which promotes sodium excretion and water retention. The other options are not correct because they either do not promote fluid retention or could actually decrease fluid retention: bradykinin increases vascular permeability and has vasodilatory effects; renin is involved in the regulation of blood pressure but primarily through increasing sodium reabsorption, which may not be as beneficial in this patient's scenario where water loss is prominent; and vasoactive intestinal peptide can also increase secretion of fluids and electrolytes into the intestines. However, its primary effect is vasodilation, and would not be expected to increase fluid retention in a hypovolemic state like the one described.

Retrieved Content: blood. Increased glycolytic enzyme activity is re-sponsible for increased consumption of glucose and galactoseand increased levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
Predicted Answer: A
Explanation: This patient most likely has a condition of chronic anemia due to thalassemia major. The peripheral smear findings in this case would be consistent with thalassemia as the echinocytes are indicative of chronic hemolysis and there is no evidence of other causes such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which also produces schistocytes when oxidized. Thalassemia is caused by mutations that affect globin synthesis, and most notably the beta-globin subunit. The rate-limiting step in heme biosynthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthase. This enzyme has been shown to be inhibited by negative feedback from ATP as well as other factors; therefore, choice A is correct and choices B and D are incorrect based on this mechanism of action. Note that choice C might seem plausible since protein kinase A activity activates the enzyme in response to low energy states (e.g., AMP). However, this effect occurs further downstream and does not affect the rate-limiting step.

The answer here is D because SSRIs (citalopram) are generally contraindicated in patients with a history of bulimia, which this patient has. A, B, and C are all incorrect choices because duloxetine, trazodone, and bupropion do not induce binge eating or purging behavior and can be effective for treating depression.

This condition is due to antibodies against parietal cells in the stomach and intrinsic factor, which are necessary for vitamin B12 absorption. The macrocytic anemia and poor balance (neuropathy) result from the lack of vitamin B12. The patient's hypothyroidism medication did not contribute to her symptoms. Islet cell cytoplasmic antibodies (ICA) target islet cells in the pancreas, as seen in type 1 diabetes mellitus; deamidated gliadin peptide is an antigen that causes celiac disease; and smooth muscle targets are involved in a condition known as scleroderma. Therefore, (A) is correct. (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect.

## Step 1: Identify the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings.
The patient presents with tingling in her feet and poor balance, indicating neuropathy. Laboratory studies show macrocytic anemia and normal thyroid hormone levels.

## Step 2: Relate the symptoms to possible underlying conditions.
The combination of neuropathy and macrocytic anemia suggests a condition related to vitamin B12 deficiency.

## Step 3: Determine the cause of the vitamin B12 deficiency.
Given the presence of atrophic gastritis, it is likely that the patient has pernicious anemia, which results from antibodies targeting parietal cells in the stomach and intrinsic factor necessary for vitamin B12 absorption.

## Step 4: Identify the correct target of antibodies based on the condition determined in step 3.
The antibodies are most likely targeting parietal cells in the stomach.

## Step 5: Match the target identified in step 4 to the answer choices provided.
Option C, Parietal cells, is the correct choice.

Predicted Answer: A: The serum osmolality is elevated and urine osmolality is low. This suggests that there must be an issue with concentrating the urine, which is best explained by a deficiency in ADH production (B). If the patient’s condition was due to a defect in the kidneys’ ability to respond to ADH (C), then serum would be normal or decreased and urine would be elevated. Choice A can be eliminated because it suggests that there is an overproduction of ADH, which would lead to more concentrated urine, not less concentrated. Choice D refers to renal tubular dysfunction; this condition involves metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, low magnesium levels, and a specific pattern on the urine Na+ vs. K+ excretion plot called the “spaghetti and meatball” effect (where sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion are both increased). This will not be seen in conjunction with an elevated serum osmolality.

Predicted Answer: A
Explanation: This patient likely has diabetes insipidus due to the high drainage output following his pancreatoduodenectomy. This condition is characterized by an inability of the kidneys to reabsorb water. In this case, because of the lack of exocrine function from his pancreas following surgery, antidiuretic hormone cannot be converted into its active form, resulting in a large amount of dilute urine. The treatment for diabetes insipidus is replacement with free water. This patient's sodium level is elevated at 154 mEq/L, indicating the presence of high volume, low concentration loss of fluid (diluted blood). Because of this, he would require IV replacement with 0.9% saline solution in order to avoid further diluting his serum sodium levels. The other options provided would not correct this patient's hyponatremic and hypovolemic state.

Variation inthe prothrombin time has been minimized by reporting thePT as
Predicted Answer: Explanation: D This question tests your understanding of how sensitivity affects statistical power and is an example of why the "specificity" trap exists in statistics and medicine. The test's specificity is 0.9 (90%), which means that when this new screening test says a patient does not have the disease, they actually do not have it 90% of the time. This is a very good screen, but it also means that only 45 out of 50 patients who are truly diseased would be detected by this test and would therefore be positive for the test. Therefore, the sensitivity is 0.9 (90%). If you were to decrease the specificity of this screening test to 70%, then more patients with no disease would be falsely said to have it. However, if this new screening test still correctly identified 45 out of every 50 diseased individuals as being positive for the test, then it now has a sensitivity of 0.9 (90%). Therefore, the false positives due to increased numbers of people being falsely diagnosed with disease would increase the total number of true and false positives to 58 out of every 100 patients tested. The statistical power is therefore calculated as follows: $\frac{45}{50} \times \frac{13}{42}$ , which equals 0.81 or 81%. If you choose answer D, make sure that you know why it is correct and understand the difference between sensitivity and specificity.

Predicted Answer: A: Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is a serious complication that occurs in patients on warfarin who have underlying deficiency of protein C. This condition tends to occur within the first week after starting anticoagulation, and it can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. The patient described has signs consistent with this diagnosis (painful enlarging bruises, skin ulceration). He also has characteristics that would make him more likely to be deficient in protein C: diabetes mellitus, mitral regurgitation, and atrial fibrillation. Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent clotting factor that serves as an anticoagulant when it is activated. Therefore, the use of warfarin will decrease its activity even further, increasing the risk for this patient to develop skin necrosis. This condition can be life-threatening if not recognized and treated promptly. Intravenous administration of protein C concentrate is effective in treating this condition by replenishing the deficient clotting factor and helping to prevent further coagulopathy. The use of hyperbaric oxygen is indicated in decompression sickness, carbon monoxide poisoning, severe anemia with acute blood loss, and refractory sepsis (a condition not described). Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor that can be used as an alternative anticoagulant when warfarin cannot be used (e.g., when the INR may take several days to normalize or when patients have liver disease), but it does not treat skin necrosis caused by warfarin. Tranexamic acid reduces bleeding in patients with hemophilia and helps prevent blood clot formation after cardiac surgery, but it will not improve this patient's condition. The best answer is B.

Predicted Answer: A: Distributive shock is caused by vasodilation due to excessive release of inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, which occurs in septic patients. Warm skin is also present in these patients due to the dilation of blood vessels. Choice B is incorrect because hypovolemic shock is a form of circulatory failure caused by inadequate volume status in the circulatory system. Choice C is incorrect because neurogenic shock is associated with cold skin, not warm skin. Choice D is incorrect because obstructive shock is related to physical blockage of the circulatory system and not vasodilation.

This question requires the application of clinical knowledge to solve a problem. First, the patient's symptoms must be identified: severe pain and spreading redness along his skin up from his right foot after stepping on a sharp rock in salt water containing bacteria that produce gram-negative bacilli on a Gram stain. This is consistent with necrotizing fasciitis due to Vibrio vulnificus, a gram-negative rod found in the Gulf coast waters. The symptoms of shock are present including low blood pressure, high pulse rate, and tachypnea. The form of shock described here is distributive shock, which results from vasodilation and can be caused by sepsis due to an infection with bacteria such as Vibrio vulnificus.

Retrieved Content: 55.5.1 Growth Disorders
Predicted Answer: A: This patient presents with features consistent with Sotos syndrome, which is characterized by excessive growth during infancy and early childhood due to an activating mutation in a receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates cell growth. The most characteristic feature of this disorder is accelerated growth rate; affected children grow faster than their peers for the first 2-3 years of life, but experience normal or slightly delayed pubertal development. Affected individuals may also exhibit intellectual disability and facial dysmorphism (frontal bossing). A similar presentation is seen in patients with Weaver syndrome, which shares similar genetic mutations. In both disorders, accelerated growth rate results from the overactivation of mTOR signaling pathway. The mTOR pathway controls cellular processes such as cell growth and protein synthesis. While there are some differences in physical features between Sotos syndrome and Weaver syndrome (with those affected by the latter disorder exhibiting more pronounced features of acromegaly), both disorders result in accelerated growth during childhood that is not accompanied by a similarly increased rate of bone elongation. Consequently, these children often exhibit disproportionately short limbs with normal length axial skeleton at an early age. This patient’s presentation is most consistent with Sotos syndrome; thus, the correct answer is A.

Quinidine is less effective in suppressing automaticity than sodium channel blockers of class IB, which are more potent at high doses but have a narrower therapeutic index.

Explanation: The sudden change in heart rate and blood pressure post-exercise is due to a baroreceptor reflex. Baroreceptors are located within the carotid sinus and in other locations throughout the arterial system (notably the pulmonary arteries). They detect changes in blood pressure, and this information is transmitted to the medulla oblongata, where it causes an appropriate response. The response includes activation of the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart rate and blood pressure if they are too low, or its inactivation along with activation of the parasympathetic nervous system (vagal response) when they are too high. This reflex is responsible for most of the day-to-day regulation of blood pressure and was a significant reason why James Black won the Nobel Prize in 1988 for developing propranolol, which acts as an adrenergic blocker to prevent this effect.

The patient described has difficulty swallowing both solids and liquids, which suggests a problem with his esophageal swallow mechanism. In this case, the vagus nerve (CN X) is most likely involved because it provides motor innervation to the muscles of the pharynx, which are responsible for swallowing. Swallowing is a coordinated process that involves several cranial nerves (CNs), but CN X is primarily involved in this patient’s symptoms due to his difficulty initiating esophageal swallows. The other options can be eliminated because CN VII (the facial nerve) is not directly related to the swallow mechanism, and CN IX (the glossopharyngeal nerve) provides sensory innervation that is more relevant to the initiation of swallowing rather than its coordination. Finally, CN V (trigeminal nerve) has no direct involvement in swallowing.

Predicted Answer: A: The symptoms presented by this patient suggest a deficiency in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which results in delayed puberty and impaired sense of smell. Kallmann syndrome is caused by impaired migration of GnRH neurons during fetal development; it presents with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (resulting in delayed or absent sexual maturation) and anosmia. The patient's inability to smell the gas, delayed growth velocity, and physical examination findings support this diagnosis. Kallmann syndrome is often inherited as an X-linked recessive trait but may also be inherited as an autosomal dominant or sporadic condition.

Predicted Answer: A) The patient described likely has tuberculosis given the chronic cough, progressive loss of weight, night sweats and radiographic evidence of consolidation at the apices of the lung. The results on his complete blood count are suggestive of infection - his hemoglobin is slightly low (11 g/dL), indicating mild anemia; his total white cell count is elevated at 16,000/mm3; there is a slight predominance of lymphocytes over neutrophils; and his erythrocyte sedimentation rate is significantly elevated. This suggests that the patient has a chronic infection and granulomatous inflammation that can be seen in TB (choice A). Histoplasmosis also presents with granulomatous inflammation, but this is more typically found in the lower lobes of the lungs rather than the apices. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis often involves a combination of symptoms including fever, anemia, and renal dysfunction, which were not mentioned in the patient’s presentation (choice D). Nodular sarcoidosis can present in the form of masses that may be found on chest radiographs; however, this condition is less likely given the patient's history of weight loss and low-grade fevers. The description given in choice B is suggestive of necrotizing granulomatous inflammation associated with Wegener’s disease or granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), which can also involve other parts of the body. It does not typically present as consolidation at the lung apices, nor is it often characterized by the loss of weight described in this patient.

Predicted Answer: A: This scenario is most likely monochorionic-diamniotic twins because they share the same placenta but have separate amnios and sacs; the smaller twin has a higher risk for serious anomalies, including heart defects and growth restriction, which are hallmarks of this type of twinning. The mother had no prenatal care, so the anomalies were not detected in utero, and there is no mention of any cardiac findings on the echocardiogram that was presumably done during initial stabilization. Furthermore, the newborns' weights do not indicate a significant weight disparity (more than 20%), which is typical for monochorionic twins with different amounts of shared placental tissue. The smaller twin has left-sided clubfoot, and the larger twin has polycythemia (increased hematocrit). This is consistent with a scenario in which the smaller twin has heart defects that are causing decreased perfusion to his/her lower extremities, leading to clubfoot. The increased hematocrit of the larger twin occurs because of intrauterine growth restriction, where the shared placenta had less surface area for the same number of fetuses being nourished, but also due to anemia in the smaller twin from decreased perfusion to the GI tract and skin; this decrease causes an increase in red blood cell production by the larger twin.

Predicted Answer: A: The pulmonary wedge pressure is equivalent to the left atrial pressure in patients without left heart obstruction and represents the central venous pressure plus any external pressures. It should approximate the right atrial pressure, as well. When both pressures are normal, then the right atrial pressure must also be normal (in this case, 0 mmHg). The RV pressure is equal to the RA pressure because they represent a single unit. A right ventricular end-diastolic pressure that approximates the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure would most likely occur when both chambers are functioning normally. Therefore, choice C is correct. Choices A and B might be seen in conditions such as cor pulmonale or severe cardiac failure of the left ventricle, where RA pressures are elevated, and right-sided heart failure, respectively. Choice D might occur if there was a significant pulmonary artery stenosis or severe tricuspid regurgitation. (This latter condition would lead to an elevated RV end-diastolic pressure because the patient's heart would be unable to contract against a severely increased RA pressure.)

Explanation: This question requires interpretation of information provided in a clinical scenario and application of knowledge about substance abuse disorders. The patient is described as being unresponsive 90 minutes prior, with empty medication bottles present, indicating a possible overdose. Fluctuating level of consciousness in this context would most likely indicate that the substance was an alcohol or other sedative, which is often associated with hallucinations (A). While the clinical scenario could be caused by many things including multi-infarct dementia, alcohol abuse can cause either condition, but the key point here is the fluctuating level of consciousness which strongly suggests a substance-related etiology. Irreversibility (B) would occur after death; hence, this choice is incorrect as there is no indication that the patient has died. Normal vital signs (D) are not expected in an overdose situation and thus do not make sense in this clinical scenario. 

Note: While multi-infarct dementia could be a contributing factor, the fluctuating level of consciousness most strongly suggests intoxication rather than dementia; hence, choice C is incorrect.

Predicted Answer: A: The ATP2A1 gene encodes a specific protein that pumps Ca2+ ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum during muscle relaxation. If this pump is defective, then Ca2+ ions will remain in the cytosol, resulting in increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Because muscles are unable to relax and return to their resting state quickly enough, there would be an overall increase in muscle relaxation time. Thus, choice A is correct. Choice B is incorrect because it suggests that both muscle relaxation time and cytosolic calcium ion levels increase. This would occur if the sarcoplasmic reticulum were less efficient at pumping Ca2+ ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum during active contraction rather than being defective in its ability to pump Ca2+ into the sarcoplasmic reticulum during muscle relaxation. Choice C is incorrect because the cytosolic calcium ion concentration would increase if there was a deficiency in this enzyme. Choice D is incorrect because it suggests that both muscle relaxation time and cytosolic calcium ion levels decrease, which are not expected outcomes for mutations in the ATP2A1 gene.

Choice A lists actin filament assembly, which would result in a disease characterized by muscle weakness (actin filaments are primarily involved with muscle contraction). Choice B is incorrect because the patient's immunoglobulin levels are decreased, so he likely has an issue with B-cell maturation.

Predicted Answer: A) This patient presents with signs and symptoms consistent with a stroke; specifically an ischemic stroke based on his history and physical examination findings of hemiparesis, extensor plantar response, and dysarthria after awakening from sleep. The best next step in managing this patient is to determine if he has carotid artery stenosis or occlusion that may have contributed to his stroke presentation, as indicated by the bruit over the right carotid artery in the neck. Therefore, a duplex ultrasonography of the neck should be performed before any imaging studies of the brain are done to avoid unnecessary radiation and contrast agents.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient's symptoms suggest that he is experiencing primary aldosteronism and needs an aldosterone receptor antagonist. Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic that also serves as an aldosterone receptor antagonist, has the additional benefit of being less expensive than other agents in this class (Choices B and C). However, spironolactone can cause gynecomastia due to its anti-androgen activity, making it potentially less desirable for men. Eplerenone, choice B, is a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist that will suppress mineralocorticoid but not glucocorticoid effects (unlike the other choices). It has less of an effect on androgen levels than spironolactone, although its side effect profile is otherwise similar to that of spironolactone. This makes eplerenone a good choice for men with primary aldosteronism and concerns about sexual dysfunction as side effects.

Explanation: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used as a first-line treatment for depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Common sexual side effects of SSRIs include weak tumescence, low libido, decreased orgasmic capacity, anorgasmia, and erectile dysfunction. The sexual side effect profile is more common with the use of paroxetine and fluoxetine than it is with citalopram or sertraline. Therefore, switching to either a different SSRI (C) or bupropion, which has a different pharmacologic mechanism, would be effective (B). Lowering the dose of citalopram may help but will not eliminate all sexual side effects and could decrease its efficacy as an antidepressant. Selegiline is primarily used in treating Parkinson disease and does not have the same antidepressant effect. It also can cause sexual dysfunction with use.

Predicted Answer: A: Chlorhexidine is an antimicrobial agent that can inactivate a broad spectrum of viruses and bacteria. It does not readily degrade and maintains its effectiveness on a nonporous surface for up to 6 hours after application. This contrasts with ethyl alcohol (D), which has a short shelf life, loses effectiveness quickly when it is applied to a surface, and degrades completely within about 30 minutes on a contaminated surface, making it unavailable for continued antimicrobial activity. Chlorhexidine is also not commonly used as an antiseptic in the treatment of skin or mucous membrane infections because its application can cause local irritation. Sodium hypochlorite (B) is a strong oxidizing agent that readily degrades into water and salt when exposed to air, making it not useful for the disinfection of surfaces where residual activity would be beneficial. Sulfuric acid is too corrosive to be used as an antiseptic or on some surface materials, and even if it were applied under ideal conditions (e.g., at a pH that was not caustic), its strong acidity would degrade organic material on the surface of objects being disinfected, making it unlikely to leave residual antimicrobial activity.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient presents with symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon (indicated by the sunburned face and bilateral joint pain) and a systemic autoimmune disease. The physical exam also reveals characteristic erythema over the maxillary prominences, which suggests malar rash, a key feature of SLE. Thus, it is most likely that this patient has SLE, and decreased complement levels are seen in patients with active SLE. (Note: Decreased complements indicate disease activity.) B and D are not correct because anti-centromere antibodies and anti-topoisomerase I antibodies (anti-Scl-70) are associated with scleroderma, a different autoimmune disease that also causes Raynaud's phenomenon but is characterized by skin fibrosis.

Predicted Answer: A: A ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Fluoroquinolones inhibit DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV by competing with Mg+2 for binding sites in the active site of these enzymes, preventing the enzymes from separating and rejoining DNA strands during replication and transcription. Resistance to this type of drug usually involves point mutations in the target enzyme genes. Thus, (B) is correct. (A) is incorrect because the bacterial cell wall will not protect bacteria against fluoroquinolone antibiotics since they inhibit enzymes critical for replication and transcription that are located inside the cytoplasm rather than on the cell surface. Replacement of D-alanine also does not provide resistance to this antibiotic, so (A) is incorrect as well. Ciprofloxacin binds to a site on its target enzyme outside of the active site, which is where the substrate and Mg+2 bind. The drug cannot inhibit DNA gyrase until it has bound to the enzyme, making an enzymatic inactivation mechanism impossible. Thus, (C) is also incorrect.

Choice A is incorrect because these medications do not affect monoamine neurotransmitter release. Choice B is incorrect because these drugs do not inhibit serotonin reuptake; if anything, they decrease thyroid hormones that influence serotonin regulation. Choice C is incorrect because stimulation of norepinephrine release would actually increase thyroid hormone production rather than decrease it.

2diffusion. It was pointed out earlier that blood and

Predicted Answer: A: The Aa gradient is a measure of the difference in oxygen tension between arterial blood and alveolar gas. An elevated Aa gradient indicates an area of the lung where hypoxia exists due to problems with ventilation, perfusion matching, or diffusion capacity. This patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with heart failure (CHF). The physical exam findings of jugular venous distension and crackles in both lungs suggest that fluid is accumulating in the alveoli. In CHF, a left-to-right shunt develops due to increased flow through diseased pulmonary capillaries that are unable to accommodate normal flow, resulting in a situation in which areas of lung units have low ventilation per unit of blood flow (V/Q ratio). This situation results in an elevated Aa gradient because areas with high perfusion and low ventilation will have low oxygen tension. Thus, (C) is the best answer.

Predicted Answer: A: The patient has symptoms that are consistent with heart failure, such as shortness of breath and increased use of pillows at night in order to sleep comfortably. Heart failure can also be associated with chronic alcohol consumption which appears to be the case here. While these findings make a cardiac cause likely, a chest X-ray is often used as an initial test for suspected heart failure and would be a reasonable next step. An electrocardiogram (ECG) may have been conducted in response to his previous ‘heart attack’ however it doesn’t directly relate to the current presentation of difficulty breathing after short periods of exercise. A stress test might be relevant if this patient had symptoms consistent with angina, such as chest pain that radiates down the left arm and is relieved by rest. An echocardiogram could provide useful information regarding cardiac function but would not typically be conducted before a chest X-ray in this context.

Predicted Answer: A: The clinical presentation is suggestive of hereditary spherocytosis. The osmotic fragility gap is normal, making it unlikely that this diagnosis is correct. The infant has a Coombs test negative anemia with hemolysis and a normocytic anemia pattern. This suggests the enzyme deficiency is likely glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). G6PD is important in maintaining the balance of NADPH and NADP+ within cells. An allosteric inhibitor of G6PD is adenosine monophosphate (AMP). AMP is an allosteric activator of PK, which will lead to increased glucose breakdown when AMP levels are high. When AMP is low, as in rest periods, PK is less active and the cell conserves energy. The normal physiological activity of G6PD is maintaining this balance and keeping NADPH levels high even during periods of low glucose availability. The question stem asks for an allosteric inhibitor of this enzyme.

82.4.5 Infection
Predicted Answer: A
Explanation:
The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory studies suggest a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis. Red blood cell transfusions would most likely have prevented this patient's oropharyngeal symptoms because they reduce the amount of oxidative damage caused by free iron released from hemoglobin in lysed red cells, thus preventing oropharyngeal ulcers.

The other options are incorrect because they do not address the pathogenesis of this patient's condition. Hereditary spherocytosis is a genetic disorder that results from mutations affecting proteins in the red blood cell membrane. Although it can be caused by abnormalities in genes (ie, CD44, band 3, ankyrin, or protein 4.2), none are associated with gluten sensitivity, vitamin B12 deficiency, or folate deficiency.

This patient's father had gallstones, which is consistent with a possible diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis as it can be caused by similar genetic mutations affecting band 3 and causing an imbalance in the pH within certain cells. This results in an excess formation of bilirubin, leading to a variety of symptoms including gallstone formation.

A factorial study would also involve more than one factor (e.g., type of medication and duration of therapy). The between-patient randomized study is incorrect because it refers to the randomization of multiple groups versus individual subjects within those groups. A cluster-randomized trial involves clustering individuals into groups based on some variable such as hospital or clinic and then randomly assigning the group to receive one of two interventions.

Predicted Answer: A) This patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS is characterized by both arterial and venous thrombosis. Antiphospholipid antibodies can lead to clot formation in otherwise normal patients. These antibodies are directed against phospholipids that are necessary for coagulation cascade processes to occur properly. A Mixing study, or dilute Russell’s viper venom time (dRVVT), will be normal and not prolonged if the patient has antiphospholipid antibodies (the mixing study is a control) because adding normal plasma with no antibodies “cures” the abnormal test result due to the phospholipids from normal plasma being present in high concentrations. DVT is also associated with Factor V Leiden, which will increase prothrombin time. The PTT mixing study is used for diagnosing heparin therapy and is prolonged if heparin is present, not antiphospholipid syndrome.

•   Urine 
–  Reducing substances–  pH–  Ketones
Predicted Answer: A: The high serum ammonia concentration in a 3-day-old infant, along with the increased orotic acid to creatinine ratio on urinalysis and absence of urinary ketones, points towards a diagnosis of carbamoyl diphosphate synthetase (CPS) deficiency, an enzyme involved in the urea cycle. This disorder leads to the accumulation of ammonia in the blood due to the inability to convert ammonia into carbamoyl phosphate in the liver. The elevated orotic acid levels in urine is a characteristic finding in CPS deficiency because carbamoyl phosphate should have been used up in the synthesis of citrulline, thereby preventing orotic acid from being broken down further into uridine monophosphate and thereby accumulating in urine. Therefore, this baby most likely has an enzyme deficiency in A: Ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient is a young woman who has experienced significant pelvic pain and weight loss over several months along with an adnexal mass. These findings are consistent with an ovarian cancer, which can be derived from germ cells. The most common ovarian cancers include those derived from germ cells (serous cystadenocarcinoma) and the sex-cord stromal tumors (granulosa cell). Of note, clear-cell ovarian cancer is less common but still a consideration for women of this age group. While endometrial cancer can also occur in young women, it would be atypical to have an associated adnexal mass; thus, choice C is incorrect. Chorionic epithelial cells are found in choriocarcinoma (choice B), which occurs after pregnancy. Because the patient's urine pregnancy test was negative, this makes choice B less likely. Choice D refers to sex-cord stromal tumors and does not fit well with a hypoechoic adnexal mass seen on ultrasound. The most common type of sex-cord stromal tumor is an estrogen-producing granulosa cell tumor, which would be atypical for causing the pelvic pain described in this patient. A different type of sex-cord stromal tumor called a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor can cause virilization and thus might fit better with the pelvic pain if it were a consideration in this patient.

Predicted Answer: A: This question requires the integration of multiple physical examination and laboratory findings into a diagnosis, which is a key aspect of Internal Medicine. In this case, the patient presents with symptoms of an acute eye process (uveitis) accompanied by signs of chronic inflammatory back pain and heel pain. The latter two are classic manifestations of seronegative spondyloarthropathies such as AS or psoriatic arthritis, although in this scenario, it is most likely that the patient has AS due to his lack of a history of psoriasis, DACTYLT (dactylitis), enthesitis, and conjunctivitis. He is also at risk for eye complications such as acute anterior uveitis, which can be asymptomatic until it causes significant vision loss. The laboratory findings further support an inflammatory arthritis given the elevated ESR and CRP levels, making A the best choice because dry mouth is a known symptom of Sjögren syndrome, which would not explain his heel pain or back pain.

Explanation: A The key findings on physical examination in this case are photophobia, lacrimation, and itching along with swelling that involves both eyes bilaterally. Given these symptoms, the diagnosis is conjunctivitis, specifically viral conjunctivitis given the lack of fever or any other systemic signs of illness. In a patient with an allergy to cephalosporins, first-generation (e.g., cephalexin), second-generation (e.g., cefuroxime), and third-generation (e.g., ceftriaxone) antibiotics should be avoided. However, the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefepime is safe for use in patients with severe penicillin allergies and may cross-react with other cephalosporins. Cefepime can be used to treat conjunctivitis if viral causes have been ruled out (e.g., PCR on conjunctiva). Thus, the best choice here is A, as a third-generation cephalosporin would be the best treatment option for bacterial conjunctivitis in this patient who does not actually have an allergy. This eliminates B and C since bacitracin and tetracycline are not typically used to treat this condition (and also note that topical or oral antibiotics may be indicated for other types of eye infections). D is incorrect because azithromycin would be contraindicated in the case where there is a true allergy to cephalosporins.

This is consistent with option A, as the tearing of the middle meningeal artery causes bleeding between the dura mater and the skull, leading to an increase in intracranial pressure and compression of the underlying brain.

The described physical examination of the infant strongly suggests Patau syndrome or trisomy 13 (the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms), which has been associated with low-set ears and retrognathia with abnormal extremity development. Hepatosplenomegaly is a sign of congestive heart failure, which can also result in pulmonary hypoplasia; however, the infant's physical examination does not point to any cardiac anomalies.

Predicted Answer: A) This patient's lab results indicate pancytopenia due to a decrease in production of blood cells from the bone marrow. Aldesleukin is an interleukin-2 receptor antagonist used for melanoma that works by suppressing T-cell activation, but it can also have immunosuppressive effects which would be counterintuitive given the lab results. Interferon beta (B) is a medication used to treat multiple sclerosis and works by activating immune cells. Filgrastim (C), however, is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor used in cancer chemotherapy that stimulates production of white blood cells, but this would be counterintuitive given the lab results as well. Romiplostim (D) is an immunomodulatory medication used for myelofibrosis and thrombocytopenia that works by stimulating megakaryocyte production to increase platelet counts. However, these patients had decreases in all blood cell types and would be more likely to be started on a medication such as prednisone (not listed) which is an immunosuppressive corticosteroid. Another option could have been azacitidine which is an antineoplastic that can cause pancytopenia but the most likely option given is aldesleukin and its immunomodulatory effects in cancer chemotherapy.

Predicted Answer: A: This baby was born at 27 weeks' gestation and shows signs of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), including low lung volumes, air bronchograms, and ground-glass opacities on chest x-ray. The condition is often associated with hyaline membranes lining the alveoli on biopsy and is most effectively treated with surfactant replacement therapy. Bilateral pleural effusions can be seen in conditions like pneumonia or congenital heart disease; however, they would not be expected to present concurrently with RDS in this case. A cord culture showing corkscrew-shaped organisms (Candida) might indicate a congenital infection but is unlikely in an otherwise healthy neonate who has no other signs of illness such as sepsis, skin lesions, or lethargy. The finding of meconium-stained fluid on deep suctioning would be more consistent with a scenario where the baby was growth-restricted and had chronic hypoxia leading to premature bowel maturation, and is unlikely in this case.

Predicted Answer: A
Explanation: The most common cause of end-stage renal disease in patients with sickle cell disease is an autosomal dominant trait called sickle cell nephropathy or sickle kidney disease. Sickle cell nephropathy typically presents with chronic low-grade proteinuria, microalbuminuria, and impaired glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as the initial findings. This disease process usually progresses slowly over many years before end-stage renal disease is reached. Membranous glomerulonephritis,  (A), is a known complication of sickle cell disease. The patient's age, gender, and ethnicity all increase his risk for developing membranous glomerulonephritis. Proximal renal tubular acidosis,  (B) , and impaired urine concentration ability,  (D) , are not associated with this patient's condition. Impaired diluting ability, however, is a known complication of sickle cell disease as a result of the sickling process causing damage to the collecting ducts in the kidneys and impairing the ability to concentrate or dilute urine appropriately. The risk factors for developing end-stage renal disease include age greater than 35 years; proteinuria; hypertension; and family history of kidney disease. This patient is at increased risk for developing membranous glomerulonephritis based on his age, gender, ethnicity, and the fact that he has sickle cell disease.

Predicted Answer: A: The inferior vena cava is located near the level of L3. It would be the most likely structure injured in this case. The internal iliac veins do ascend as high as L3, but they are not the most likely structures injured because their course is more laterally positioned at this level. The renal arteries arise from the aorta and would be less likely to be injured from a penetrating wound below L3. Similarly, the portal vein courses through the liver and its location makes it unlikely that it would have been injured by a gunshot wound at the level of L3. (Choice B is incorrect; choice C is incorrect because the renal artery does not traverse the area in question; and choice D is incorrect since the vessel in question runs above the liver.)

Explanation: The ACGME guidelines state that a resident cannot exceed a total of 80 hours per week for any individual period of time. This resident currently works and trains 60 hours per week as a resident plus an additional 10-hour shift on Saturday equals a total of 70 hours, leaving him with 10 more hours to work outside his residency obligations without going over the 80-hours/week maximum. However, this does not take into account the 3 days he takes off during the upcoming week. When adding another 10-hour shift back in during one of those days, the total would exceed 80 hours per week, indicating that the resident is already overcommitting and must reduce his moonlighting hours to be compliant with ACGME guidelines.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient's blood pressure is within normal limits but he has an increased heart rate and respirations. The body responds to a stressor such as a motor vehicle accident by increasing its heart rate and respiratory drive.

A prolonged PTT indicates that there is a problem within this cascade and points towards factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, V, II, I, or fibrinogen being defective. The formation of bradykinin also involves factor XII as it breaks down to form kallikrein and inactivates kininogen to produce bradykinin. So, the most likely abnormality is a defect in factor XII.

Predicted Answer: A: The dose of amoxicillin that is needed for steady-state plasma concentrations can be calculated by multiplying the desired concentration by clearance: 15 L/h x 2 mg/L = 30 mg/h. Because the drug will be administered twice per day, and each dose will need to last 12 hours, then (30 mg/h) × (12 h/dose) = 360 mg/dose.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient has spherocytes on peripheral smear along with a low reticulocyte count and negative Coombs test indicating that she most likely has hereditary spherocytosis. Flow cytometry for CD55/CD59 is the best next step because it will help us confirm the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis by looking at the proteins on the surface of red blood cells. Hereditary spherocytosis typically presents with decreased or absent expression of these two proteins. (Choice A) The Eosin-5-maleimide binding test is used to diagnose stomatocytic anemia, a rare hereditary condition where the red blood cell membrane has increased fluidity and flexibility but does not relate to this patient's presentation.

Predicted Answer: A) Primary hyperaldosteronism is less common and also not directly related to his history of hypertension that has worsened over time; it is often associated with hypokalemia which was not reported here.
B) Hypothyroidism, another cause of secondary hypertension would present with symptoms such as fatigue or cold intolerance. Given the absence of these symptoms in this case, this option is incorrect.
C) Stiffening of the aorta (or calcification), also known as "medial calcific sclerosis", presents differently and is more common among diabetics. It presents in advanced stages of hypertension with significant impact on renal function; its presence would be associated with unremarkable carotid, renal or abdominal bruits.
D) Aortic stenosis (AS) could have been a consideration if the systolic murmur had been associated with symptoms of AS such as angina, syncope or effort intolerance which were not present in this case. Therefore, given that he is asymptomatic and the presence of split S2, his condition suggests increased volume load without any evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. His blood pressure readings are consistent with renovascular disease which was confirmed by the absence of atherosclerotic bruits elsewhere; an ultrasound would be used to further evaluate this finding.

Predicted Answer: A: Recurrent pregnancy loss is defined as three or more consecutive pregnancy losses before 20 weeks of gestation. The patient in this question has experienced four miscarriages and meets criteria for recurrent fetal loss. For patients with a history of recurrent fetal loss, the general consensus among experts is that treatment should begin at the time of conception to prevent another loss, rather than starting once pregnancy is confirmed through ultrasound. Aspirin and heparin have been shown to be effective in preventing miscarriages in this population. This combination has been studied extensively; it works by decreasing inflammation and clotting in the placenta. Although warfarin was previously used for pregnant patients with a history of recurrent fetal loss, the use of warfarin is associated with an increased risk of birth defects and should be avoided. Furthermore, rivaroxaban is an anticoagulant medication that has not been studied extensively for the prevention of miscarriages in this population.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient presents with signs of pneumonia, as evidenced by the cough, fatigue, crackles on pulmonary exam, and fever. Given his age and underlying comorbidities, he is a high-risk candidate for complications from this infection (e.g., respiratory failure, sepsis). As such, IV antibiotics should be initiated in the hospital setting. Although azithromycin can be used to treat community-acquired pneumonia, it is typically used as monotherapy when outpatient treatment is considered appropriate (Choice B). In contrast, moxifloxacin is a more reliable choice for treating patients with comorbidities and those who are at risk of complications from infection. Furthermore, the decision to admit to the medical floor versus intensive care unit (ICU) depends on multiple factors including severity of illness, response to treatment, and presence of other high-risk conditions. This patient does not have any acute findings that would necessitate ICU admission (e.g., need for vasopressors, severe respiratory distress). Therefore, Choice A is the most appropriate answer.

Predicted Answer: A) The patient has ascites as suggested by the presence of shifting dullness. Although paracentesis would provide a definitive diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis if the fluid is turbid and cultures positive, this may not be immediately available on the ward or at night. Thus, empiric antibiotics are appropriate when there is clinical suspicion for SBP despite a clear ascitic fluid, as in this patient with scleral icterus and jaundice consistent with advanced liver disease, combined with an elevated WBC count of 19,000 cells/μL, which indicates an infectious cause. The patient does not appear to be in shock based on blood pressure, pulse, or mentation. Thus, IV fluids are appropriate as well.

Reasoning Skill for Medical Inference: The reasoning required here is the ability to evaluate information from various clinical findings and apply knowledge of liver disease complications to generate a plan that prioritizes the most appropriate immediate action while considering other possible next steps. This requires integration of information across multiple domains and the ability to prioritize competing goals based on an understanding of relative risks, benefits, and urgency in this patient's specific situation.

Retrieved Content: 102 Coagulation Disorders: Clinical Aspects of Platelet Disorders 777
Predicted Answer: A: In this patient, the ristocetin cofactor assay is decreased, which would suggest a platelet issue as opposed to an intrinsic coagulation pathway problem. The decrease in factor VIII activity and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) might suggest an inherited deficiency of either factor VIII or IX. However, it does not match the ristocetin cofactor assay findings. Factor XI deficiency would present with decreased aPTT values but normal platelet function. Antithrombin III is associated with heparin and other anticoagulant pathways rather than bleeding disorders. The bleeding disorder presented in this patient would most likely be due to abnormalities of the glycoprotein (Gp) Ib/IX/V complex, which are responsible for binding vWF to platelets. This condition typically presents as mild bleeding due to platelet dysfunction but can manifest with severe bleeding when the GpIb is affected. A deficiency in the GpIb would lead to a similar clinical presentation seen in this patient, and would also result in a decreased ristocetin cofactor assay, making (A) correct.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient's symptoms are concerning for preterm labor because she is experiencing contractions every 2 minutes that are increasing in intensity, which could potentially harm her fetus and lead to premature birth. Misoprostol (B) is a medication used to induce labor but is not the best next step here. Nifedipine (C), another medication for preterm labor, is given orally and takes longer than 30 minutes to take effect. Therefore, it would also not be the best choice in this situation where contractions are occurring every 2 minutes. Dilation and evacuation (D) is a procedure that is performed when there is no fetal viability or a confirmed diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. This patient's fetus is at 26 weeks' gestation and appears to have normal development, as shown by ultrasound; thus dilation and evacuation would not be the best choice here. A better answer choice is allowing vaginal delivery (A) for this patient because her cervix is dilated to 5 cm, 70% effaced, and there are no other indications of distress or complications, such as fetal abnormalities on ultrasound or maternal fever or bleeding.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient has a case of septic arthritis due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcus) that was acquired during her camping trip. The presence of intracellular diplococci in the leukocytes from the arthrocentesis is particularly suggestive of this diagnosis. In addition to sexually transmitted disease, another strong risk factor for gonococcal septic arthritis would be a history of intravenous drug use (B). Although this patient does not have such a history, it was a major risk factor for septic arthritis in an otherwise healthy 22-year-old man described in the question preceding this one. Autoantibody production is the mechanism involved in rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases (A) that are quite different from gonococcal septic arthritis. Although sexual transmission of gonorrhea is a major public health problem, it does not directly influence its risk for causing septic arthritis. Therefore, choices C can be eliminated from consideration. HLA-B 27 positivity is the strongest genetic marker associated with ankylosing spondylitis and many other spondyloarthropathies (D), which are different from gonococcal septic arthritis. This patient's condition is a classic example of a "seronegative" form of arthritis in that there is no accompanying autoimmune disease or elevated titer of autoantibodies.

125.4.2 Blood Count
Predicted Answer: A: The patient described in this question has what is called "nephritic syndrome," a clinical condition where there is inflammation of the glomeruli and acute injury of renal tubules. The presence of effacement of podocytes on electron microscopy suggests that he also has membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). In this disease, there would be increased numbers of granular casts in the urine as well as albumin, consistent with tubular damage from a nephritic syndrome. MPGN can be an immune complex-mediated process and could be triggered by infections like streptococcus. Therefore, option A is incorrect because hyaline casts are typically seen in minimal change disease (MCD), which presents with massive proteinuria but normal renal function and no evidence of tubular damage as would be expected here.

Predicted Answer: A: A 52-year-old female patient presenting with a headache that is worse in the morning, associated with mild papilledema and imaging findings of a solitary lesion in the temporal region predominantly hemorrhagic, most likely represents metastatic disease to the brain. This patient's history of hypertension and obesity could suggest primary renal cell carcinoma; however, the age and gender of this patient make lung cancer more likely as the source of her metastasis. Lung cancer is one of the most common sources of brain metastases in patients who are not small-cell carcinoma. Small-cell carcinoma tends to be aggressive with a predilection for the basal ganglia and corpus callosum, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, choice A is correct. Lung cancer typically metastasizes to the brain by the direct hematogenous pathway and less commonly through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Melanoma can also metastasize directly to the brain but would be associated with skin melanomas or other visceral cancers like the GI tract, as mentioned earlier. Multiple myeloma is not a primary cancer that causes metastatic disease in the brain; however, it does cause a form of amyloidosis called AL amyloidosis. This can affect nerves within the brain and spinal cord as well as peripheral nerves. Thyroid cancer also has been known to be associated with metastases to the brain but usually is associated with papillary carcinoma. The most common presentation of metastatic disease from thyroid cancer would be a single lesion in one hemisphere (choice D). However, this would be very unusual given this patient's age and gender.

Predicted Answer: A: The narrowing of retinal arteries and microaneurysms seen in this patient are indicative of diabetic retinopathy. This condition arises from tissue-specific differences in expression of sorbitol dehydrogenase, which is more highly expressed in the retina than in other tissues. In the eye, glucose diffuses into the lens and retina where it accumulates due to a lack of insulin. Sorbitol dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of glucose to sorbitol within these cells, leading to the accumulation of sorbitol, which pulls water into the cell by osmosis. This causes cellular swelling and eventually retinal damage. (B), galactocerebrosidase deficiency leads to Krabbe disease, a neurological disorder with symptoms such as muscle weakness, seizures, blindness in infants, and eventual death. Patients who have this condition exhibit demyelination due to the inability of myelin-forming cells called oligodendrocytes to break down sphingolipids that are present in their cell membranes. (C), arylsulfatase A deficiency leads to metachromatic leukodystrophy, a form of lysosomal storage disease. Symptoms include seizures, muscle weakness, and mental retardation beginning at any age between infancy and adulthood. (D) sphingomyelinase deficiency is associated with Niemann-Pick disease type A, a rare genetic disorder that causes an accumulation of sphingomyelin in the brain, lungs, spleen, liver, and bone marrow due to the inability of myeloid cells to break down sphingomyelin from cellular membranes.

Acidosis
Predicted Answer: A: The description of recurrent episodes since birth that resolved spontaneously in a patient who has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and was recently started on glipizide should raise suspicion for allopurinol-induced hyperuricemia leading to acute gouty arthritis, which can cause dark urine, fatigue, and joint pain. Gout can be precipitated by several factors, including the initiation of diuretic medication such as hydrochlorothiazide and thiazides, but not glipizide. However, another type of medication may also be implicated in the patient's symptoms. The glipizide is a sulfonylurea used to treat diabetes mellitus. Sulfa drugs are known to induce hyperuricemia. Other side effects include fever, rash, arthralgias, and rarely agranulocytosis. Therefore, in this patient with poorly controlled type II DM on glipizide, the most likely cause of his symptoms is a sulfa drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction (a.k.a. Stevens-Johnson syndrome), which is also known as allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome when it occurs after taking allopurinol for gout prophylaxis.

114.2.5 Prevention
Predicted Answer: A: This patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) based on his history of smoking, symptoms of a productive cough, shortness of breath, and radiographic findings. COPD exacerbations are an inflammatory process and should be initially treated with glucocorticoids. Prednisone is more convenient than prednisolone because it can be given PO or IV. Albuterol is the preferred beta-agonist for COPD exacerbation. Therefore, A is correct. Choice B is incorrect because montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that does not contain glucocorticoids and therefore cannot address an inflammatory process. Choices C and D are incorrect because tiotropium is an anticholinergic inhaler used for long-term COPD management as well as theophylline, which has numerous side effects.

Predicted Answer: A
Explanation: This patient has symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is defined as a lower airway obstruction that causes airflow limitation. The FEV1/FVC ratio is decreased and the FEV1 falls below 80% predicted. In addition, residual volume often increases in patients with COPD because of trapping of air during exhalation due to narrowed airways.

Predicted Answer: A: The low pH and high Pco2 levels in this patient's arterial blood gas sample indicate acidosis of respiratory origin since it would be expected that if there was a problem with ventilation, the level of CO2 (Pco2) in the arterial blood would not be within normal limits. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), choice A, is a type of metabolic acidosis. The patient's symptoms include low levels of bicarbonate (HCO3-), which also supports that she has some degree of metabolic acidosis occurring simultaneously with her respiratory acidosis. DKA would explain the metabolic component but not the respiratory component of this patient's acidosis. Therefore, A is incorrect. Choice B, a diuretic overdose, could cause hypokalemia (low potassium levels) and could lead to Kussmaul breathing (hyperventilation). However, it would not lead to low blood pressure since there would be less fluid within the circulatory system after being lost through urine. Therefore, this patient's hypotension cannot be explained by choice B. Choice C, hyperventilation, could result in a decreased CO2 level in arterial blood but not an increased one as is seen here. Therefore, it is incorrect. A narrowed or pinpoint pupil along with respiratory depression are both signs of opioid overdose. The patient's low pH and high Pco2 levels support her having some degree of respiratory failure. Also, the respiratory rate is lower than expected for a normal adult female (12-16/min).

Predicted Answer: A: Atrial fibrillation is a chaotic, disorganized atrial rhythm that typically presents as a rapid, irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG. This condition can be precipitated by factors such as severe hyperthyroidism, cardiac surgery, myocardial infarction, and ethanol intoxication (as seen in this patient). The patient's presentation of palpitations and dizziness is classic for atrial fibrillation. Option B, Brugada syndrome, would present with a different ECG pattern, called the "Brugada sign," which consists of ST segment elevation in leads V1 and sometimes V2. This sign does not appear to be present on this patient's ECG. The patient would also likely present with sudden cardiac death from ventricular fibrillation as his first manifestation of disease. Option C, ventricular tachycardia, is a fast rhythm originating from the ventricles that can cause palpitations and dizziness but does not have an irregularly irregular rhythm as seen on this ECG. Option D, sick sinus syndrome, is caused by dysfunction at or above the SA node level, leading to heart block, bradycardia, or tachy-brady syndrome. This condition would likely present with a slow heart rate rather than palpitations and dizziness.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient's presentation is highly suggestive of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), a sexually transmitted disease caused by certain serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis. The "painful mass" in the groin area described is consistent with bubo, which typically occurs as a result of LGV infection. This condition would more likely be associated with Chlamydia trachomatis than with other sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis or genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. Gram-negative rods are present in "school-of-fish formation" on the Gram stain from specimens obtained from the ulcerations caused by LGV, and PCR for Chlamydia trachomatis is positive in patients with this condition.

Choice B is incorrect. This patient's presentation and symptoms are most likely due to lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), which is a sexually transmitted disease that results from infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, not Chlamydia trachomatis alone.

Choice C is incorrect. The patient in this case is more likely to have lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), caused by certain serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis, which would result in positive PCR tests for Chlamydia trachomatis but not positive results on RPR, VDRL, and FTA-ABS tests. These latter tests are used to diagnose syphilis.

The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) opens early during ischemia, allowing ions to enter the mitochondria. Once open, this pore cannot close, resulting in cell death and a more significant injury than initially apparent. Caspase activation is typical of apoptosis, not reversible cellular injury (choice B). Lysosomal rupture would be seen with necrotic cells rather than those undergoing penumbra or "injury" changes (choice C).

Predicted Answer: A
Explanation: A Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome is characterized by a repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep and is often associated with obesity, large neck circumference, larger male gender, and larger age. The AHI helps define the severity of OSA. An AHI < 5 per hour is normal, while an AHI of > 30 per hour indicates severe OSA. Choices B and C are incorrect because episodes of apnea/hypopnea occur most frequently during light stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep.

Predicted Answer: A: The formula for calculating a loading dose of heparin is as follows:
Loading dose = (Target peak plasma concentration × Volume of distribution) The volume of distribution for heparin in this patient would be 60 mL/kg × 50 kg, which equals 3 L. If we plug that into the equation with a target peak plasma concentration of 0.5 units/mL, we get: Loading dose = (0.5 units/mL × 3 L) = 1.5 units × 3 L/mL = 4.5 units/L × 1000 mL/L = 4500 units.

Explanation:
Telomerase is most likely associated with increased activity in the cells of this patient’s tumor, a liposarcoma. Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures that cap the ends of chromosomes and prevent them from fusing together. Telomerase catalyzes the addition of TTAGGG repeats to telomere ends, which can lead to cancer if present at high levels in somatic cells (i.e., cells that are not part of germ lines). Cancer has been found to arise when telomeres are elongated by telomerase activity. Telomerase is inactive in normal somatic human cells but activated in the majority of cancers, including liposarcomas.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient presents symptoms of hypothyroidism and parkinsonian features, including slow speech and movement, tremor, delayed deep tendon reflexes, constipation, joint pain, fatigue, weight gain, palpitations, and bradycardia. Her past medical history is significant for asthma and family history of poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis. The key finding here will be an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level. Choice A is correct.

(B) Choice B is incorrect because the patient does not present symptoms of depression, which would likely include reports of low mood or anhedonia. Her difficulty concentrating could be related to hypothyroidism, but it is not indicative of major depressive disorder (MDD). While she has experimented with LSD once 6 years ago, there are no current drug use findings from the history and physical exam that would suggest substance-induced depression.

(C) Choice C is incorrect because anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) are found in rheumatoid arthritis. However, her symptoms of joint pain and delayed reflexes do not point toward rheumatoid arthritis, and thus, this would be an incorrect choice.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient's symptoms are most consistent with a hot tub folliculitis, caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The inflammation in this condition originates from the hair follicles of the skin, which makes choice B correct. A common predisposing factor for this infection is exposure to contaminated water (e.g., swimming pools or whirlpools). Hot tub folliculitis typically presents as numerous small pustules that develop several days after exposure to the contaminated water.

The remaining options are incorrect because they do not relate to the origin of hot tub folliculitis.
(A) The epidermis is the outermost layer of skin, and hot tub folliculitis originates from hair follicles deeper in the dermal layer. The superficial portion of the dermal layer contains sweat glands.
(B) This choice is correct because hot tub folliculitis begins in the epithelium lining the hair follicle (follicular infundibulum). After a short incubation period, the infection progresses to involve the rest of the hair follicle and the adjacent skin. 
(C) The papillary dermis is the superficial portion of the dermal layer, which contains sweat glands and nerve endings but does not contain hair follicles.

Explanation
The physical examination described above is suggestive of an impingement syndrome of the shoulder, which is most likely caused by a rotator cuff injury. This patient's weakness in external rotation and pain on lowering his arm suggests that the supraspinatus tendon is most likely injured. The supraspinatus muscle is primarily responsible for stabilizing the glenohumeral joint as it rotates externally. It is also responsible for assisting with abduction of the humerus, which can also explain this patient's weakness in abduction.

Predicted Answer: A: The tuberculin skin test is a method for diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection. It involves placing a small amount of tuberculin fluid just beneath the surface of the skin and measuring the resulting inflammation in the form of induration (swelling) after 48 to 72 hours. A positive reaction indicates previous exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, although it does not confirm current active disease. In immunocompetent individuals with latent TB infection, the tuberculin response is due to the production of cytokines such as interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon-gamma (IFN-\(\gamma\)), which activate macrophages that are able to kill M. tuberculosis. T cells also produce these cytokines by interacting with antigen-presenting cells via their B7 molecules and CD28 ligands. This activation of macrophages impairs the growth of M. tuberculosis. The patient in this question has HIV infection, which is a state of immunocompromised. In such individuals, there are high levels of IL-4 produced by T helper 2 (Th2) cells that interfere with macrophage function and thus produce a negative tuberculin skin test result. Th1 cytokines such as IFN-\(\gamma\) are depressed in HIV infection, making the use of the tuberculin skin test less reliable for screening for latent TB infection. It is also worth noting that some individuals who have previously been vaccinated with the BCG vaccine may also have a positive tuberculin skin test because they have been exposed to a similar organism (Mycobacterium bovis) that is used in the BCG vaccine.

Retrieved Content: Biochemical/hormonal MeasurementsFirst check blood glucose levels. If there is severe or symp-tomatic hypoglycaemia, the levels of GH, cortisol and ACTHshould be measured. If found to be high because of stress(e.g., difficult venous cannulation), then pituitary functiontests may be avoided.
Predicted Answer: A: This question requires a clear understanding of how dexamethasone testing can help confirm suspicion of pituitary adenoma (Cushing's disease), which can be confirmed by measuring ACTH levels in response to low- and high-dose dexamethasone suppression testing. A normal response is for cortisol levels to decrease with both low- and high-dose dexamethasone. Individuals with Cushing's syndrome have an abnormal response, characterized by increased cortisol levels after taking a low dose of dexamethasone (which would suppress cortisol production in normals) but decreased cortisol levels after taking the higher dose. A key feature of this question is that it tests the ability to interpret the results. The correct answer will result from understanding how Cushing's syndrome affects the body's response to dexamethasone suppression testing. Therefore, (A) is correct. Both low- and high-dose dexamethasone suppress cortisol levels in normal individuals; thus, (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect.

Predicted Answer: Explanation for correct answer: Karyotype of the fetus can be diagnosed by chorionic villus sampling, amniocentesis, or a postmortem examination after delivery in such cases. In the present question the karyotype is not mentioned anywhere. But the patient has been having a mass protruding from vagina and the USG has shown no fetal parts which suggests that it is an abnormal gestation (mole). So the fetus will have a karyotype of 46XX, i.e., two X chromosomes. In molar pregnancies, there are two types: complete hydatidiform mole and partial hydatidiform mole. The complete mole occurs when an empty egg is fertilized by a single X chromosome from the sperm (i.e., no maternal genetic material). This results in all cells being 46XY. However, it can also be completely formed from paternal chromosomes only with no maternal contribution or be triploid, i.e., having 69 chromosomes instead of the normal 46, with three sets of chromosomes, one set each from both parents and a third set which is entirely paternal. The partial mole contains some fetal parts in addition to hydropic villi. So, if we rule out option A (because we have no information about karyotype) and option C (because it's unlikely to be an XY fetus and besides the karyotyping for this kind of thing should have been given), then the remaining options B and D are to be differentiated as follows: The complete hydatidiform mole is entirely due to the fertilization of a single ovum by a sperm. Hence, all the cells in the molar mass will be 46XY or 69XXY (the triploid form). This rules out option D which says 46 XX.

Predicted Answer: A: The changes that occur in respiratory function with aging include a decrease in forced expiratory volume, and an increase in residual volume and closing volume. Thus, choice B is correct. Lung compliance decreases with age due to loss of elastic recoil of the lung. Therefore, choices A and C are incorrect. The alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient does not increase with age.

Predicted Answer: A): The patient's symptoms are suggestive of internuclear ophthalmoplegia, which is a disorder caused by demyelination in the medial longitudinal fasciculus, a bundle of nerve fibers that coordinates conjugate horizontal movements of the eyes (conjugate horizontal eye movement). This condition leads to an inability to adduct one eye on lateral gaze. The patient has this deficit in her right eye when looking left and in her left eye when looking right. She also has nystagmus in the other eye when she looks in the direction that causes difficulty with adduction, which is consistent with internuclear ophthalmoplegia. The most common cause of internuclear ophthalmoplegia is multiple sclerosis. This patient likely had a mild concussion from her bike accident and an MRI would have shown evidence of this condition. B is incorrect because there are no focal findings suggestive of a tumor in the pons (e.g., weakness, ataxia).

Predicted Answer: A) The patient has taken acetaminophen but states she took "a few pills." This situation is a classic example of an Acetaminophen overdose where the quantity of pills was unknown and therefore potentially high enough to cause liver failure, which can occur 16-20 hours after ingestion. This makes N-acetylcysteine (NAC) appropriate therapy at this point. Activated charcoal should be administered within an hour of ingestion for maximal effect but is not going to help in this scenario due to the timing. IV fluids are indicated because the patient may have taken other medications and their hydration status is unknown, but they will not protect against acetaminophen toxicity. Syrup of ipecac was used to induce vomiting but it has been shown to be ineffective for most overdoses, can cause gagging, and even lead to aspiration in patients who are unconscious.

Predicted Answer: A: Variable expressivity refers to a condition where a single genotype results in variable symptoms or manifestations in different family members. This is consistent with the presentation of this patient's family and his nonaffected status. Maternal uniparental disomy would occur if one member of a dizygotic twin pair inherited all chromosomes from one parent, but this does not apply to the pedigree shown. Gonadal mosaicism occurs when there are two populations of cells within an individual (one normal, one abnormal) and can be seen in individuals who have seemingly sporadic disease, but it is less likely given the pedigree pattern shown. Incomplete penetrance would refer to a condition where one genotype does not result in any symptoms, which does not apply in this case since there are clearly affected family members with that same genotype.

Predicted Answer: A: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha is a cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of septic shock. Neisseria meningitidis infections typically result from bacterial meningitis caused by gram-negative rods. These infections are often characterized by high fevers, confusion, dyspnea, hypotension, petechiae, purpura, and positive Kernig and Brudzinski signs. This patient's symptoms and lab results make Neisseria meningitidis the most likely cause of her bacterial meningitis and septic shock. A: TNF-alpha is a cytokine that plays a key role in systemic inflammation during infections like Neisseria meningitidis, which causes septic shock in this patient. The other options are not associated with the pathogenesis of septic shock caused by gram-negative bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis. Interleukin-5 is produced primarily by activated CD4+ T cells, mast cells, and basophils. It plays a role in the regulation of IgA production and B cell growth. Interleukin-12 is secreted by macrophages and promotes Th1 response development, which leads to increased cytotoxicity against infected cells. Interleukin-4 is primarily produced by mast cells, basophils, activated T lymphocytes, and NK2 T cells, and plays a role in IgE production and B cell activation. These cytokines do not play a key role in the pathogenesis of septic shock associated with gram-negative bacterial infections such as those caused by Neisseria meningitidis.

Explanation: A fracture of the scaphoid bone is a common injury in patients who fall on an outstretched hand. Symptoms and signs include wrist swelling, tenderness between the extensor pollicis longus and brevis tendons, decreased motion, decreased sensation over the thumb, and a painful radial or dorsal wrist. If left untreated, there can be avascular necrosis of the scaphoid bone with eventual arthritis. A good way to evaluate for this is by doing an x-ray series in 2-3 weeks to see if any fracture fragments are present. Typically, two views of the wrist (anterior-posterior and lateral) will not identify a scaphoid fracture because it is often located just distal and proximal to the midline of the wrist. Therefore, a more detailed view (scaphoid view) is needed, as well as a view from 45 degrees on each side to evaluate for any occult fractures. An MRI may also be used if there is suspicion of scaphoid fracture and an x-ray is negative but clinical suspicion remains high.

 Choice A is correct. Choice B is incorrect because while an MRI could be used in cases where an x-ray is negative, the best first step would be to get a radiograph, as described above. Choice C is incorrect because thumb spica casts are typically used for Skier's thumb (a gamekeeper's thumb) injury, which involves a ligamentous injury of the ulnar collateral ligament at the base of the thumb. A scaphoid fracture should not be treated with a cast and requires imaging studies as described above to confirm or rule out the diagnosis. Choice D is incorrect because while a radial gutter cast may be used for certain wrist fractures, it would not be appropriate for a suspected scaphoid fracture.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient has cystic fibrosis (CF), which is an autosomal recessive disease meaning it is caused by mutations in both copies of a gene on chromosome 7. The genotype for CF patients is typically homozygous recessive (hh) whereas the genotype for those without the disease is heterozygous (Hh). In this question, let H represent the normal allele and h represent the diseased allele. Her parents would have to both be carriers of the disease (genotype: Hh), which means her mother's genotype was either (1) Hh or (2) hh because if she were HH, then there is a 0% chance she could pass on a disease-causing allele to the child (which makes option B incorrect). Since she has CF herself and also had parents, it would mean that one of her parents must have been sick with CF. If either parent is homozygous recessive for cystic fibrosis then there is a 100% chance that they will pass on their disease-causing allele to the child. Therefore, in order for the patient to have CF, each of her parents would have had to be Hh. Her father, however, does not have this disease, so therefore he must have been (1) HH or (2) hh because if either were true, then there is a 0% chance that he could pass on a disease-causing allele to the child. This leaves only one option for her father and that means her father's genotype was (1) Hh. Therefore, his genotype was (Hh). Since both parents are carriers of the diseased gene, each child has a 25% chance of being homozygous recessive (hh), which would cause the disease; therefore there is a 75% chance that they will not have this disease. This means that 1/4 or 25% of their children would have the disease and 3/4 of their children, or 75%, would not, making option A correct.

Predicted Answer: A: This condition is known as familial juvenile chronic arthritis (FCJA), which presents similarly in males but milder symptoms in affected females. The disorder is characterized by joint disease that leads to an elevated level of uric acid and eventual kidney failure, often resulting in the premature death of both male cousins. Males inherit only a single X chromosome; therefore, when a son inherits an abnormal X chromosome, he will express the disease because there are no normal genes on his sole X chromosome to compensate for this gene's mutation. A mother would be asymptomatic as her two X chromosomes would contain at least one copy of the mutated gene. Female cousins who inherit only one of their mother's X chromosomes containing the mutation may have symptoms, but usually these symptoms will be milder compared with those experienced by male family members. Therefore, this disorder follows an X-linked recessive pattern. (Choice B) This choice is incorrect because if a mother were to pass on the mutated gene, it would appear in all of her offspring. The disease would not skip generations as observed in this pedigree. (Choice C) This choice is incorrect because inheritance of autosomal dominant genes will be passed on equally between parents and their offspring. (Choice D) Mitochondrial inheritance is a rare mode of transmission that can be inherited only from the mother.

Predicted Answer: A) The patient's symptoms of irregular menstrual bleeding, oily skin, severe acne, hirsutism, tall stature, BMI slightly above normal, increased LH, and low FSH levels suggest an androgen excess disorder. Given her age, height, and other laboratory values, the most likely diagnosis is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Measurement of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) and cortisol can help identify a rare but serious cause of PCOS, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which would be characterized by an elevated level of 17-OHP. Elevated levels of 17-OHP can also indicate nonclassic CAH. Because patients with CAH are at risk for developing Cushing syndrome due to increased ACTH production by the pituitary gland, this is the most appropriate next step in screening for comorbidities in this patient. B) A raised level of CA-125 can be found in a variety of conditions that cause ascites or peritoneal irritation but would not directly relate to the symptoms of this patient. C) Blood glucose and cholesterol levels are elevated in some patients with PCOS, as they often have insulin resistance. D) Measurement of TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and T4 (thyroxine) can help determine whether hypothyroidism is a contributing factor to her menstrual irregularities; however, the presence of hirsutism and other clinical findings in this patient make it less likely that she has hypothyroidism.

Predicted Answer: D
Explanation: (D)  The conducting airways and upper airway are anatomical dead space, which refers to the volume of gas that does not participate in gas exchange. This includes the upper airway volume (100 mL), conducting airway volume (125 mL), as well as residual volume (RV) (1,000 mL). The RV is the amount of air left behind in the lungs after a maximal expiration and thus does not have an opportunity to participate in gas exchange. Therefore, D is correct. To calculate this answer, you must be able to add these volumes together: 100 + 125 + 1000 = 1,225 mL.

Predicted Answer: A) Metformin is an oral antidiabetic agent that works by decreasing glucose production in the liver. However, this mechanism can lead to a rare but serious condition called lactic acidosis, which occurs when metformin inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase and increases lactate levels in tissues with inadequate oxygenation. This side effect is much more common in patients with heart failure, liver disease, or other conditions that increase the risk of tissue hypoxia. Although not directly causing an elevated liver function test (transaminitis), metformin can contribute to a patient’s elevated liver enzymes through lactic acidosis and subsequent tissue damage.

This histopathologic picture is suggestive of celiac disease, especially given the patient's long-standing diarrhea and malabsorption (indicated by weight loss). Celiac disease would also explain her anemia and low serum albumin levels. In contrast, the other options are less likely causes of this presentation: secretory diarrhea is not usually associated with carcinoid tumor or VIPoma.
