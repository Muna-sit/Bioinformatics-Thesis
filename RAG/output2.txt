Predicted Answer: A: This patient likely has vernal conjunctivitis, which is a seasonal condition that typically occurs in young males, often during springtime when grass pollen counts are highest. The symptoms of itchy and watery eyes along with sneezing are common manifestations of this disease. Treatment options include erythromycin ointment (A) for bacterial superinfection prophylaxis, fluorometholone eye drops (D) for mild inflammation (steroids can be used in vernal conjunctivitis), and warm compresses (C) to help loosen crusts and debris from the eye. Ketotifen eye drops (B) are also appropriate as they can inhibit mast cell degranulation, which reduces the release of histamine that contributes to itchiness. However, considering all options, ketotifen is most appropriate for this patient's symptoms because it specifically addresses a key symptom of vernal conjunctivitis, namely itchiness due to the action of histamines.

3. A transient systolic murmur due to tricuspid regurgitation
Predicted Answer: A: In standing from a supine position, a decrease in intrathoracic pressure will cause a reflexive increase in venous return; consequently, right atrial pressure increases. The mid-systolic murmur is consistent with pulmonic stenosis (PS) or pulmonary regurgitation (PR). PS involves an obstruction to the flow of blood between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, which results in a decreased slope of the pacemaker potential (choice C), decreased diastolic filling time (choice D), and increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (choice B). Therefore, choice A is the best answer.

Predicted Answer: A: The described phenomenon is an example of a "reassortment" process where different strains of viruses exchange their genome segments. Only some types of viruses have segmented genomes that are capable of reassorting. Epstein-Barr virus has a single-stranded DNA genome that cannot be reassorted. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has a single-stranded RNA genome and does not undergo reassortment. The rotavirus is an RNA virus that contains segments that can reassort, but this viral mechanism of reassorting its segments produces strains with different antigenic properties than the strain described in question 3. However, vaccinia virus is a DNA virus that has been genetically engineered to be capable of undergoing reassortment and serves as an appropriate example of a system where two viruses coexist within a host cell and undergo genetic reassortment.

Predicted Answer: A: The first step in any diagnostic process is to exclude a diagnosis that may lead to significant morbidity and mortality if not treated appropriately. Acute cholecystitis could be a life-threatening condition if not managed promptly with antibiotics and cholecystectomy, especially given the patient's history of recurrent abdominal pain due to gallstones. Therefore, acute cholecystitis should be excluded first in this patient (Kovács, 2017). The most likely diagnosis for this patient is pancreatic cancer, which often presents with jaundice and a palpable mass that may be calcified in the head of the pancreas. This patient's history of recurrent abdominal pain due to gallstones, combined with her family history of pancreatic cancer, makes pancreatic cancer the most likely diagnosis (Kovács, 2017). Pancreatitis is not an appropriate choice because it would have presented with a different constellation of symptoms (abdominal pain and tenderness that radiates to back, fever and elevated white blood cell count), as well as the patient would be unable to tolerate food (Kovács, 2017).

When intestinal bleeding is seen, MD should be considered.
Predicted Answer: A: The findings of prominent rugae in the stomach, weight loss, and a history that spans more than 6 months are consistent with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which is caused by an ectopic gastrin-secreting tumor (choice D). Gastrin secretion leads to increased gastric acid production. This excessive acid can lead to peptic ulcer disease or damage to the stomach lining. Parietal cell atrophy (seen in pernicious anemia) would likely be seen with diminished acid production, not increased. Prominent rugae (the folds on the mucosa of the stomach), however, are often associated with the elevated acid production that occurs with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Secretion of serotonin (choice A) is more closely associated with carcinoid tumors, which can also cause peptic ulcers, but they do not typically cause gastric atrophy or rugal hypertrophy. Bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine (choice B) would lead to malabsorption and weight loss, but it would not specifically cause an increase in acid production as seen in this patient. Excessive somatostatin secretion (choice C), which can be caused by a gastrinoma (a tumor of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), leads to decreased acid production.

Damage to this tract would result in the inability to repeat verbal instructions, as seen in the patient described in the question stem. Therefore, answer A is correct. The superior temporal gyrus (B) is primarily involved with Wernicke's area and damage here would typically produce a syndrome of fluent aphasia without comprehension of speech or language, which was not demonstrated by the patient in this case. The inferior frontal gyrus contains Broca's area, which is primarily involved in spoken language production; however, the patient described in the question stem had recovered most of his ability to speak fluently. Therefore, B and C are incorrect. Damage to all three areas (D) would result in a mixed non-fluent aphasia syndrome that was not seen with this patient; thus D is also incorrect.

Explanation:
The best answer is A. The patient's symptoms of altered mental status (AMS), slurred speech, and ataxia in a homeless individual who has been arrested for public intoxication are consistent with acute ethanol poisoning. Ethanol can be used as an antidote by competitively inhibiting the metabolism of ethylene glycol, methanol, and isopropyl alcohol, but it should not be administered in this patient's case since ethanol levels are normal. However, if the patient's symptoms persisted after administration of the appropriate antidote, ethanol could help to decrease metabolic rate and decrease the demand for NAD+ by competitively inhibiting its use in glycolysis (this is known as a "sobering up" effect). The other options do not treat alcohol intoxication. Naltrexone does not have any effect on AMS caused by alcohol. Naloxone is used to reverse opioid overdose, and fomepizole is used specifically for ethylene glycol poisoning.

Since the incidence of death from cardiac causes was higher in the medication 2 group compared with medication 1, we will calculate the NNT as follows: NNT = 1 / ( Incidence rate medication 1 - Incidence rate medication 2) = 1 / [0.0897 - 0.1400] = 1 / (-0.0503) = 19.9 ≈ 20

However, in this case, the patient's symptoms are likely due to overactive parasympathetic tone because of her use of galantamine.

Failure
Predicted Answer: A) Proceed with liver biopsy

This question requires analysis of a clinical scenario involving a patient with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis presenting with a new liver nodule and enhancement on imaging studies. The appropriate next step in management would be to proceed with a liver biopsy. This is because the presence of liver nodules in a patient with chronic alcohol use should raise concern for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is more common in patients with cirrhosis. A liver biopsy can confirm or rule out HCC, and guide further management.

Option B refers to surgical resection, which would be appropriate if the diagnosis of HCC was confirmed by biopsy or imaging, but it's not the next step without a definitive diagnosis. Option C mentions radiofrequency ablation (RFA), which is an ablative therapy for small HCC lesions, typically less than 3 cm in size, without evidence of vascular invasion or metastases. However, RFA would be premature without confirming the diagnosis by biopsy first. Option D suggests observation and follow-up imaging, but this is not appropriate given the new finding of a liver nodule in a patient with cirrhosis, which warrants further diagnostic workup.

Predicted Answer: A: The patient's symptoms of a pruritic hypopigmented rash on his upper body and the recent return from a trip in the Bahamas make this case most consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), also known as creeping eruption. CLM is caused by the larvae of certain nematodes (roundworms) that are typically found in sand or soil, such as Ancylostoma braziliense and Ancylostoma caninum. The rash often appears within a few days after exposure to infested soil or sand, as occurred with this patient. CLM is characterized by serpentine lesions that can appear anywhere on the body but are most commonly found on the lower extremities. It typically resolves on its own in 2-8 weeks. Treatment for CLM includes topical and systemic antiparasitic drugs. The rash described in this case, which appears to have started as a single lesion on the upper back with an extension to his shoulders is consistent with CLM. A Wood lamp examination can help confirm the diagnosis of certain skin conditions, such as vitiligo or psoriasis; thus, it would be the correct choice for confirming the diagnosis in this case. The other options are not correct because a skin culture (B) and potassium hydroxide preparation (C) would be used to diagnose fungal infections of the skin and are not relevant to CLM. A skin biopsy is rarely needed for diagnosing parasitic infections such as CLM, making it an incorrect choice.

Diagnosis is based on the exclusion ofother causes of liver disease, such as neonatal lupus and he-mophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and by evidence of ironoverload with high serum ferritin, high trasferrin saturation(>95%), and by MR imaging of the liver and pancreas.
Predicted Answer: A: The patient's high transferrin saturation and serum ferritin levels point to a diagnosis of hemochromatosis; this is a genetic disorder that causes an accumulation of iron in the body. Over time, excess iron can deposit in various tissues and cause damage. The hand radiograph shows heaved subchondral bone typical of osteoarthritis secondary to iron overload. Therefore, **(A)** is correct. Gout is characterized by swelling over joints on one side of the body (e.g., all on left or right sides), whereas this patient has bilateral involvement; therefore, **(A)** can be eliminated as an answer choice. CPP disease usually presents with calcification in the cartilage and menisci but does not present with these radiologic findings; so, **(B)** is also incorrect. The lab values are suggestive of a different syndrome than systemic inflammatory response; therefore, **(C)** can be eliminated as well. This patient does have an infectious process (diabetes mellitus), but it is not the etiology for his joint pain. Therefore, **(D)** is incorrect.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient has "blue right baby syndrome" and is suffering from a cyanotic congenital heart defect. The physical examination clues of the loud S2 and the machine-like murmur at the upper sternal border, along with the enlarged egg-shaped chest on x-ray, point strongly to transposition of the great vessels as the most likely cause. Atrial septostomy (Rashkind procedure) is a diagnostic and sometimes therapeutic maneuver used in these cases to allow mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Coarctation of the aorta would not result in cyanosis. The murmur would also be different, being an interrupted second heart sound heard at the back. Persistent truncus arteriosus results in only one great vessel (aorta) arising from a common area behind the ventricles and does not produce cyanosis; thus, patients with this disease are "pink" or "red." Tricuspid atresia is another cyanotic heart defect but would not result in the described physical examination findings. The murmur associated with tricuspid atresia may be a systolic rumble heard best at the left lower sternal border.

The patient's presentation of shortness of breath, chest pain that worsens with breathing or coughing, and hemoptysis is classic for a pulmonary embolism. Furthermore, the fact that she was found to have a filling defect in her pulmonary vessels confirms this diagnosis. Surprisingly, despite administration of an appropriate treatment (i.e., heparin), her standard coagulation panel tests came back within normal parameters. This strongly suggests that this patient has a hereditary condition that causes hypercoagulability. The most common cause of hypercoagulability in young patients is a deficiency in antithrombin, which can be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.

Predicted Answer: A: This individual was likely infected with N. gonorrhoeae . Many pathogens that produce exotoxins can infect an individual and still cause future infections due to the immune system's inability to provide lasting immunity against these toxins (choice A). Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because they describe scenarios where the pathogen is able to evade immunity through means other than toxin production. For example, some bacteria have polysaccharide capsules that can prevent antibodies from accessing the bacterial cell surface (choice C), or others may undergo antigenic variation (choice B). However, N. gonorrhoeae does not typically cause these types of infections.

Predicted Answer: A: The spinal cord contains neurons that relay information between the brain and lower body structures (sensory fibers) as well as those that carry motor signals from the upper body to the lower body (motor fibers). Therefore, destruction of the spinal cord would affect both sensory and motor functions on one side of the body. The man described in this question had cancer that was treated with a subtotal gastrectomy; such surgery can damage the left recurrent laryngeal nerve or other structures near the spine. A complication of subtotal gastrectomy is thoracic outlet syndrome, which occurs when the mediastinal structures are compressed by an enlarged left subclavian artery, causing unilateral atrophy of neurons in the spinal cord. The correct answer is (A).

This question requires you to consider the appropriate steps for a patient presenting with symptoms of Lyme disease. The patient's history of a tick bite, fever and chills, headache, neck stiffness, rash, and musculoskeletal pain should alert you to this diagnosis. The next step in management would be antibiotic treatment, which is most appropriately started by using amoxicillin (C), the drug of choice for early Lyme disease. Ibuprofen (A) could be given as a short-term measure for relief from joint symptoms but does not treat the underlying condition. Tetracycline and gentamicin are both contraindicated in pregnancy, making them inappropriate choices.

118.1.4 Differential Diagnosis
Predicted Answer: A: The woman is most likely infected with influenza virus, which typically causes symptoms such as fever, headache, malaise, and dry cough. Influenza A virus contains a helical capsid and has a segmented genome. People who have been previously exposed to influenza can make hemagglutinin-inhibiting (HAI) antibodies that are directed at the viral surface protein hemagglutinin (HA). These HAI antibodies provide cross-reactive protection against other strains of influenza virus. The son, who had symptoms during the past week but is currently free from symptoms, likely made HAI antibodies to a strain of influenza that he contracted and then recovered from. Therefore, his immune system would be able to recognize and neutralize this strain of flu virus (choice B), as well as other strains of flu containing hemagglutinin, thereby protecting him from the current strain of influenza infecting his mother. The ICAM-1 protein is primarily involved with leukocyte adhesion and diapedesis; downregulation of its expression would not protect against infection by a virus (choice B). Protease-resistant antibodies in nasal secretions would give cross-reactive protection against other strains of flu that have hemagglutinin, but this is not the best choice because it does not account for the son having symptoms and then recovering. The CCR5 gene does not play a significant role in immunity to influenza; therefore, it is not relevant in this context (choice D).

Predicted Answer: A: This 8-year-old girl presents with hematuria and proteinuria following an untreated streptococcal infection. The symptoms of this patient are consistent with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), which is characterized by the immune complex deposition. In PSGN, the immune complexes form between antigens from the bacteria and antibodies in the blood. These immune complexes can activate complement and lead to inflammation of the renal glomeruli. Antigen-specific IgE binding to mast cells is associated with allergic reactions. Tissue-specific antibodies are associated with autoimmune diseases such as Graves' disease or myasthenia gravis. Presensitized CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity, not relevant here. (Choice B) This patient's symptoms of hematuria and proteinuria were most likely caused by the deposition of antigen-antibody complexes within the glomeruli of her kidneys. The correct answer is C.

Thus, A is correct. Answers B and D are incorrect because there is no indication of conjunctival injection or nystagmus in this patient's presentation.

Predicted Answer: A: The patient is presenting symptoms of adrenocortical insufficiency. A metyrapone stimulation test would be used in this case as a screening tool. If there was sufficient reserve, administration of the drug would increase the production of 11-deoxycortisol and subsequently cortisol. However, because her levels were not increased after the administration of the drug (choice D), it is likely that she has insufficient adrenocortical reserve; therefore, administration of the drug would result in an increase in serum ACTH due to a feedback loop trying to stimulate some more hormone production (choice A). Because she has insufficient cortical function, there are decreased levels of both urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (choice B) and serum cortisol (eliminate choices B and D). The only substance that would be decreased in the patient with insufficient adrenocortical reserve is 11-deoxycortisol. The metyrapone stimulation test increases production of this hormone, which is why choice C is correct.

Explanation
The question stem describes a scenario consistent with a tension pneumothorax caused by an open chest wound. The clinical presentation of decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance on percussion in the setting of a penetrating injury is highly suggestive of this diagnosis. The management priorities for a patient with a tension pneumothorax include securing the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) followed by needle decompression. CT scan, bronchoscopy, and emergency thoracotomy would be considered as secondary steps if the patient's condition stabilized following needle decompression.

Key Concept: Tension pneumothorax is an immediate life-threatening condition that requires rapid recognition and intervention. The management of tension pneumothorax involves securing the ABCs followed by needle decompression in order to relieve pressure on the heart and lungs.

Predicted Answer: A: The correct answer is D. Specificity for a test is defined as the number of true negatives divided by the sum of true and false positives. In this case, there were 600 patients without PD. If the scan came back positive on this population, those would be considered false positives. The formula for specificity would then be: (number of true negatives)/(true + false positives). There were no false negatives since none of the diseased individuals had a negative scan. Therefore, the number of true negatives is equal to the total without PD who had a negative test, or 580.

Predicted Answer: A: This is correct. Women with a diagnosis of CIN I are considered to be at high risk for having recurrent disease in their lifetime, particularly if they have an associated HPV infection. Close observation and regular pap smears (every 6-12 months) along with HPV DNA testing may allow clinicians the opportunity to treat precancerous lesions earlier and decrease the likelihood of developing invasive cancer.

(B) Cryotherapy ablation is used for lesions that involve the entire thickness of the epithelium (CIN II), not just the lower half as seen in CIN I. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia type I, or CIN I, occurs when abnormal cells develop in only one-half of the epithelium. This represents a relatively low risk for invasive cancer.

(C) Loop electrosurgical excision (LEEP), also known as loop cone biopsy, is used to diagnose and treat cervical intraepithelial neoplasia type II or III lesions that involve the entire thickness of the epithelium but not the basement membrane. Since the patient in this question had only CIN I, LEEP would be an excessive treatment for her condition.

(D) Hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus) is a radical treatment and is considered more appropriate when a woman has cervical intraepithelial neoplasia type III or invasive carcinoma, rather than just CIN I.

Predicted Answer: A: The presence of nocturia without dysuria is a common presenting symptom in men who are experiencing benign prostatic enlargement; however, these patients will have difficulty initiating urination and may even experience some degree of suprapubic discomfort (asymptomatic BPH). In such cases, the best first step would be to perform an urinalysis and serum creatinine. These values will help determine if this patient's symptoms are related to renal insufficiency, which can also cause nocturia and decreased urine volume. A digital rectal exam is not appropriate without further investigation (such as a urinalysis). Reassurance alone would be inappropriate because the patient has tried other means of managing his symptoms that have failed. The serum PSA level is nonspecific for the diagnosis of BPH, although it is useful in screening patients with a history of prostate cancer.

Predicted Answer: A: This woman's symptoms of vaginal bleeding and dull suprapubic pain along with ultrasonographic evidence of an embryo without fetal cardiac activity are consistent with an early pregnancy loss, such as a threatened abortion that has progressed to an inevitable spontaneous abortion. The best next step is the administration of misoprostol therapy, which will help complete the miscarriage process by softening the cervix and stimulating uterine contractions. Misoprostol can be initiated after counseling regarding the potential consequences of the event on future pregnancies. This woman's uterus is consistent in size with an 11-week gestation, despite being at 12 weeks' gestation, which further supports the diagnosis of a miscarriage. Methotrexate therapy would not be indicated for this patient because there is no evidence that any tissue remains in her uterine cavity. Dilation and curettage (D&C) could be performed, but it would not alter the management in this case. Complete bed rest is not helpful as the miscarriage will occur regardless of the woman's activity level.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient's presentation is typical for primary dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea is painful cramping in the abdomen that occurs at regular intervals during a woman's menstrual cycle and is usually associated with menses. It occurs when uterine contractions are mediated by prostaglandins, which cause the uterus to contract in an attempt to expel the uterine lining (endometrium). This process can be painful due to the constriction of the uterus and surrounding tissues. Secondary dysmenorrhea is associated with a specific pelvic pathology such as endometriosis or adenomyosis. In this case, the patient's symptoms started at age 15, which is about the time she began menstruating, and her symptoms were relieved with ibuprofen, indicating that prostaglandins were involved. Choice B is incorrect because primary dysmenorrhea does not involve an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, or surrounding tissue. Choice C is incorrect as this option best describes an ovarian cyst. Primary dysmenorrhea is not associated with an ovarian cyst. Therefore, the most likely cause of her symptoms was uterine contractions mediated by prostaglandin (choice A), which made choice D incorrect. Choice D is incorrect because a leiomyoma is a benign neoplasm that would not explain her symptom pattern. Additionally, leiomyomas are more common after age 25 and in postmenopausal women.

Note: The most difficult questions will often require you to use your knowledge of how the human body functions as well as details from the question stem. In this case, if she was taking ibuprofen (which reduces prostaglandin production), then it is more likely that her symptoms were due to prostaglandins causing contractions.

In this case, there are 20 true positives and 0 false positives (because an ophthalmologist's examination confirmed the presence of CMV retinitis in the patients that were positive with the device). If the prevalence of the disease decreases, it means that there would be fewer new cases diagnosed during a given period. However, because there is no change in true or false positives and only a decrease in the number of true positives (as the population's prevalence decreases), PPV decreases. NPV is calculated as true negative divided by true negative plus false positive. In this case, there are 30 true negatives and 1 false positive. If the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreased due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, then the total number of patients with CMV retinitis (true positives) would decrease more than the number of true negatives, thus increasing NPV.

Predicted Answer: A

This question tests your knowledge of the relationship between serum sodium levels and osmolality as well as its association with the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) and the mechanism by which SIADH causes hypovolemia. The patient's laboratory findings are consistent with SIADH, which is caused by a tumor that secretes ADH inappropriately in response to decreased serum osmolality. The low sodium is caused by excessive water retention, leading to hyponatremia and hypervolemia. However, the normal skin turgor and lack of peripheral edema are clues that point away from SIADH toward the alternative: the low serum osmolality reflects the very high levels of ADH and is not associated with increased fluid volume, which would be expected in SIADH. Instead, this patient's water retention causes hypovolemia, as evidenced by the dry oral mucosa and normal skin turgor. Therefore, the serum osmolality will remain low because it is inversely proportional to ADH levels. The urine sodium will also be low because of increased reabsorption of sodium in response to decreased intravascular volume. In addition, aldosterone production increases in response to decreased blood pressure and volume loss, causing an increase in its serum concentration.

Cigarette smoking is associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung; however, this patient's weight loss and lack of hilar lymphadenopathy make a metastatic lesion less likely. In a case of bronchogenic carcinoma, honeycombing would be seen in the adjacent lung parenchyma due to scarring from the tumor.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient has a condition known as IPEX syndrome, which is characterized by immune dysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked. A mutation in the FOXP3 gene leads to a deficiency of activated regulatory T cells and results in autoimmune manifestations such as eczematous dermatitis, autoimmune endocrinopathies, and autoimmune enteropathy. Patients with this condition are at increased risk for developing type 1 diabetes mellitus (autoimmune endocrinopathy). Hemorrhagic diathesis is associated with Bernard-Soulier syndrome; ocular telangiectasias are a hallmark of Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome; and retained primary teeth are seen in conditions such as congenital syphilis. (C) is correct. The other options are not directly related to the information provided. Thus, (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect.

Predicted Answer: A
Explanation: The answer is A. During exercise, there is an increase in myocardial oxygen demand that exceeds resting levels. This necessitates increased coronary blood flow to meet these demands. Local release of adenosine contributes to vasodilation and thereby increases coronary blood flow. Prostaglandin E2 has a role during ischemia but does not contribute to the initial exercise response, choice C. Inorganic phosphate is involved in cellular metabolism, not vasodilation, so it can be eliminated, choice B. Transforming growth factor beta is related to cell proliferation and differentiation, which do not directly affect coronary blood flow during exercise, choice D.

Schizoid personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of emotional expression in interpersonal settings. In contrast, antisocial personality disorder (choice B) involves disregard for others' rights, lack of empathy, impulsivity, and aggression.

Predicted Answer: A) The patient's complaints of excessive fatigue and weakness are consistent with primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease), which can also manifest as abdominal pain, constipation, weight loss, and the bronze discoloration seen in this patient due to an increase in melanin production. This condition is characterized by decreased cortisol and aldosterone secretion from the adrenal glands. Thus, administering intravenous fludrocortisone (a synthetic mineralocorticoid with a potency similar to aldosterone) would be the most appropriate initial step in the management of this patient as it helps to address his deficiency in aldosterone production.

Predicted Answer: A: The ELISA is used in the screening process for a variety of diseases including HIV and it detects the presence of antibodies against this virus. However, when testing for the genetic material (DNA or RNA), which would confirm an infection with any disease, an ELISA will not be used because it cannot detect viral genetic material; it only detects antibodies to the disease. Choices B and C are both antibody tests that can indicate if a patient has been exposed to this disease but they do not test for the presence of the virus itself. The Southern blot would be able to detect the genetic material of HIV in a sample but it is a technique used by researchers, which would make it far too expensive for use in a hospital setting. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR), also known as DNA amplification, is a quick and accurate test that can determine if an individual has been exposed to this disease. It detects the genetic material of the virus and is sensitive enough to detect only one copy of the viral genome per sample. (See Figure 7-15.) Thus, (C) is correct and (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect.

In addition to the abdominal mass, there may be symptoms
Predicted Answer: A: This boy's presentation is consistent with neuroblastoma, a tumor composed of immature neuroblasts that typically originates in the adrenal glands or sympathetic nervous system but can be located almost anywhere along this pathway, including the thoracic spine (as seen here), where it can compress the spinal cord and cause its symptoms. The classic histopathologic appearance of neuroblastoma is sheets of small blue cells with an organoid pattern of rosettes around a central neuropil; however, in some cases, the cells may not form these rosettes and appear as if they are floating within a "fibrillary" background (hence the name). Neuroblastomas can also contain tumor giant cells that have large amounts of cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. While neuroblastoma is the most likely diagnosis here, anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma could be considered as well, but it would not cause a palpable abdominal mass, so it's unlikely in this case. Lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (option A) does not present with a tumor mass and typically is diagnosed after the detection of anemia, thrombocytopenia, or lymphadenopathy. Option B is characteristic of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, which is a less common type of renal cancer that usually affects children under 2 years old (mean age at diagnosis = 1.5 years), and which presents with a more diverse range of symptoms than this case, including sometimes presenting as an abdominal mass or by symptoms of bone metastases or anemia/bleeding from tumor cell infiltration into the bone marrow. Clear cell sarcoma is also strongly associated with 3p deletion and TP53 mutations, but there are no other specific genetic abnormalities to guide diagnosis in this scenario. While a renal tumor might be considered as well, given its rarity in young children, hepatoblastoma (option D) would present with jaundice or evidence of liver dysfunction rather than a peripheral mass.

Predicted Answer: A: The researchers are interested in studying how often HIV is related to high-risk behaviors and sociodemographic factors among female sex workers from their country. This means that the main outcome measure of their study would be a rate or proportion. Incidence measures the number of new cases that occur within a specified time period, which makes it a strong choice for an answer (A). Prevalence measures the total number of people with a particular disease or condition at any point in time; this is also a plausible choice (B). Hazard rate measures the rate at which the proportion of individuals developing a particular outcome changes over time. This could also be a possible choice, depending on how the study was designed and analyzed. However, attributable risk measures the difference in the rates of a disease or condition among those exposed to a certain risk factor versus those who are not exposed. Because there is no information provided about exposure status (in terms of whether the female sex workers were exposed to a particular risk factor), D would not be as good an answer as A or B.

Predicted Answer: A: The patient's elevated calcium level and renal findings of eosinophilic casts on biopsy are suggestive of multiple myeloma.

Reticulocytosis can occur in this disease but typically indicates bone marrow response to anemia rather than being a specific finding. The correct answer is therefore B; linear aggregations of red blood cells are referred to as "stacked coin" or Rouleau formation, a common peripheral smear finding seen in multiple myeloma patients due to rouleaux formation from aggregated red cells by the monoclonal antibody (M protein).

Predicted Answer: A: This patient has a clinical presentation suggestive of dementia and parkinsonism, which is consistent with Parkinson disease dementia (PDD) in this case. There is some evidence that early treatment with levodopa may slow the progression of PDD. The correct answer is A. Warfarin therapy for anticoagulation is not appropriate at this time because there are no data to suggest that it prevents or slows dementia. Vitamin E has been shown in a randomized controlled trial to prevent or delay the progression of cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease, but there are no similar data for PDD. Tetrabenazine may be used for treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease. Cognitive training is not likely to have an impact on this patient's condition.

This indicates that his original sexual attraction for males is suppressed (reaction formation). Sublimation occurs when an individual replaces unacceptable thoughts, desires, or impulses with more socially acceptable ones. Intellectualization is the psychological defense mechanism where an individual tries to make sense of something by thinking about it rather than feeling it.

Predicted Answer: A: Primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by a parathyroid gland tumor leading to excess PTH and calcium levels. The presentation of nephrolithiasis, increased PTH, and hypercalcemia make primary hyperparathyroidism the most likely diagnosis in this patient with untreated hypertension and calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis as presenting symptoms. (Choice B) Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism is a rare genetic disorder causing PTH resistance without hypocalcemia, making it less likely given the patient's presentation of hypercalcemia. (Choice C) Secondary hyperparathyroidism can be caused by several factors including prolonged calcium deprivation, such as in chronic kidney disease or malabsorption syndromes. The patient does not have any risk factors for chronic kidney disease and no history of gastrointestinal symptoms to suggest malabsorption. Therefore, secondary hyperparathyroidism is less likely. (Choice D) Tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs after prolonged PTH stimulation, resulting in parathyroid gland overgrowth leading to autonomous function regardless of serum calcium levels. The patient does not have any risk factors that would lead to this prolonged increase in PTH, such as chronic kidney disease or prolonged malabsorption syndromes, making tertiary hyperparathyroidism less likely.

Normal or severe cardiomegaly is present, as in case with se-vere tricuspid regurgitation.75 Cardiovascular Physiology, Pathology, and Clinical Investigation 557
Predicted Answer: A) The mechanism behind this patient’s chest pain is similar to that of Raynaud's phenomenon because it involves transient ST elevations on a 24-hour ECG during episodes of episodic chest pain. This pattern is most consistent with Prinzmetal’s angina, which occurs due to transient spasm of the epicardial coronary arteries. The presentation of transient ST elevations and relief of symptoms with vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin, further supports this diagnosis. Raynaud's phenomenon also involves vasospasms in the smaller vessels supplying blood flow to the skin of the digits. (Choice B) Myocardial infarction is characterized by permanent damage to myocardium from prolonged ischemia, which leads to an abnormal ECG that does not resolve after the episode of pain has passed. (Choice C) Aortic dissection occurs when there is a tear in the intima of the aorta, leading to an inability for the layers of the aorta to move together with each heart beat. This condition presents as acute and severe chest pain that radiates to the back and may be associated with hypotension and a palpable "hammer" within the chest wall (Hamman’s sign). (Choice D) Costochondritis is inflammation of the cartilage connecting the ribs to the breastbone, leading to sharp, stabbing chest pain.

Predicted Answer: A: This photograph shows a hazy cornea in the right eye. This is most likely caused by corneal edema secondary to acute angle-closure glaucoma. The pain and blurred vision of one eye are also consistent with this diagnosis, as well as the photophobia that typically accompanies it. In adults, the most common cause of an acute attack is a narrow or closed drainage system between the iris and cornea. A similar presentation in a child would raise concern for bilateral or recurrent attacks (the so-called "childhood glaucoma syndrome") and would prompt examination of other family members to determine if there was a genetic predisposition. The use of contact lenses, which can cause irritation, can sometimes precipitate an acute attack of angle-closure glaucoma in susceptible individuals by causing inflammation that leads to increased intraocular pressure (IOP).

Explanation:
This patient's symptoms are suggestive of beta-thalassemia minor. Echinocytes are often seen on a peripheral smear in thalassemias because there is an imbalance between the production of hemoglobin subunits, leading to a reduction in the production of adult hemoglobin (Hb A), and thus red cells become smaller but have more surface area-to-volume ratio than usual. The rate limiting step of the biochemical pathway affected by beta-thalassemia minor is catalyzed by the enzyme delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS). This enzyme is stimulated by heme through a feedback inhibition mechanism, which is why thalassemics have reduced ALA production, leading to a deficiency of globin subunits. Thus, it is the heme that normally limits the production of hemoglobin; and since this patient's condition is associated with mild microcytic anemia (i.e., conjunctival pallor), we can infer that there would likely be lower levels of heme in her red cells as well.

Predicted Answer: A
The question is describing the clinical presentation of a patient with hemophilia A, an X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the F8 gene that encodes for factor VIII protein. Deficiency of this protein leads to impaired clotting and increased risk of bleeding into joints (and possibly other areas). Hemophilia A patients are predominantly male, but females may be carriers or exhibit clinical disease when they have only one allele with a mutation. The patient described is most likely a female carrier of the F8 gene, manifesting mild hemophilia due to having just one mutated allele. Her laboratory results, which show prolongation of prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time but not bleeding time, are typical for carriers of hemophilia A. Arthrocentesis of her right knee shows bloody synovial fluid due to a joint bleed. The defect in this patient’s reaction is most likely associated with the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) because factor VIII protein is produced via translation in RER. This disease is an example of an “inclusion body disease,” where proteins that are synthesized and not properly cleaved or secreted accumulate within cells. Therefore, **(B)** is correct. Hemophilia B is caused by a deficiency in the F9 gene product (factor IX) instead of factor VIII and has similar clinical manifestations to hemophilia A. Thus, it is an alternative answer. The patient also could be described as having a mild form of von Willebrand disease that primarily affects women more frequently than men. However, this would be less likely in this case because her bleeding time (11 minutes) is not significantly prolonged, which would be expected with such a disorder. Her laboratory studies showing prolongation of prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times but not the bleeding time argue against von Willebrand disease. Thus, **(A)** is correct. This question assesses knowledge of a specific disease process and its clinical manifestations. It requires an understanding of how genetic disorders are inherited (in this case, an X-linked recessive disorder) and how different types of blood clotting tests reflect the presence or absence of certain proteins in plasma.

In the most severe cases the infantis lethargic, unresponsive, skin is pale and poorly perfused,the abdomen can be severely distended, markedly erythema-tous or discolored to inspection, tender and firm to palpation.
Predicted Answer: A: This patient's episodic abdominal pain and symptoms are most consistent with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The disease is a congenital condition of infants but can present in young children as well. It presents with recurring episodes of severe vomiting and epigastric pain that radiates to the back; the patient may also have weight loss, emaciation, and dehydration from these symptoms. In some cases, the vomiting occurs after feeding and is described as projectile, which helps differentiate this condition from other causes of episodic abdominal pain such as intussusception, appendicitis, or a perforated peptic ulcer. Physical examination reveals a palpable olive mass in the epigastric region due to hypertrophied pyloric muscle. This finding, along with symptoms and laboratory values showing anemia (from chronic blood loss), is diagnostic of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The patient described here has episodic abdominal pain that radiates to his back and that occurred over a long period; in the absence of other symptoms or physical findings, this condition should be considered likely.

Predicted Answer: A: Tetralogy of Fallot is characterized by four main findings which include: a ventricular septal defect; an overriding aorta; pulmonary stenosis; and a hypertrophied right ventricle. The presence of the boot-shaped heart seen on chest radiographs in this patient, along with other features, supports a diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot. Tetralogy of Fallot is also associated with cleft palate. Another feature that can be expected to be present in patients with Tetralogy of Fallot includes hypocalcemia due to hyperparathyroidism which leads to increased bone resorption and the release of calcium into the circulation. This, in turn, results in a variety of neuromuscular symptoms including tetany. Hypocalcemia can also cause seizures in these patients, making choice A correct. Choices B and C are incorrect because they do not correctly describe features seen in Tetralogy of Fallot; while hyperthyroidism from transplacental antibodies is seen with Graves disease, a condition that causes excessive thyroid hormone production, tetralogy of Fallot is characterized by cyanosis which can give the baby's cry a blue tinge. Choice D is incorrect because increased phenylalanine in the blood occurs in patients with phenylketonuria, not Tetralogy of Fallot.

Predicted Answer: A: This question can be difficult because of its format. However, it is a great example of how a combination of pathologic findings and clinical information can help one identify a disease process when no other clues are provided in the stem. The patient presented with seizures and hallucinations, followed by death; therefore, the answer likely involves an infectious agent that leads to CNS dysfunction. A clue about travel history is given, as the man recently returned from a camping trip where he observed bats. However, this piece of information may be misleading because many patients do not remember traveling when asked in an academic setting. The clue lies within the recent camping trip. This patient likely contracted rabies, which can present as acute CNS dysfunction and, upon progression, leads to coma and death. Rabies virus uses acetylcholine receptors for entry into neurons; therefore, the correct answer is B.

Predicted Answer: A: Niacin can cause flushing which is due to increased deposition of bile acids in the dermis and not via mast cell degranulation as might be expected since that would suggest a histamine release mechanism rather than the actual pathophysiology behind the niacin flush (choice C). The flush does, however, result from prostaglandin release (choice B), which is the correct answer. Niacin does not cause immunologic side effects at therapeutic doses and so choice D is incorrect.

Predicted Answer: A
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and travel history are most consistent with giardiasis. Giardia intestinalis is a protozoan parasite that causes watery diarrhea, which can be accompanied by abdominal pain, weight loss, and malabsorption of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. The incubation period is usually 1-3 weeks after ingestion of contaminated water or food. This patient likely ingested contaminated food from the in-flight meal or from her accommodations at the resort.
(Choice B) Shigella species cause dysentery characterized by high fever (usually >38°C), bloody diarrhea, and abdominal pain. This patient does not have fever or blood in her stool. Therefore, Shigella is unlikely.
(Choice C) Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning presents with a high fever, vomiting within 1-2 hours after eating the contaminated food, and diarrhea that develops later, but this presentation is highly unlikely for this patient given her symptoms and lack of fever.
(Choice D) Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) causes traveler's diarrhea, which typically presents with watery diarrhea without blood or mucus. However, ETEC usually has a more rapid onset, and the symptoms are typically self-limited to 1-3 days, making giardiasis a better fit for this patient's presentation.

Physical characteristics include macroorchidism (enlarged testicles) after age 12, long face, high-arched palate, large everted ears, and a long narrow jaw with almond-shaped eyes and downturned mouth. The male patient described is likely affected because he has an increased number of CGG trinucleotide repeats in the FMR1 gene, and his teachers have reported hyperactivity during class, difficulties with social interaction, and poor scores on reading and writing assessments, all findings consistent with Fragile X syndrome.

Predicted Answer: A: The  patient described above is suffering from acute decompensated heart failure, as evidenced by signs and symptoms of poor perfusion (low blood pressure), signs of fluid overload (orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, edema), and the echocardiogram findings. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that promotes urinary output to help reduce fluid volume overload and alleviate edema. Metoprolol, an β-blocker, helps decrease heart rate, which would improve contractility and cardiac efficiency in this patient's situation. Nesiritide, a B-type natriuretic peptide analogue, also has vasodilatory properties that can help with decompensation. However, digoxin is a digitalis glycoside that acts primarily as an AV nodal blocker. It works best at improving cardiac contractility in patients with stable heart failure and an ejection fraction of less than 45%. The patient described above should not be given digoxin because it would only depress the cardiac output further, thereby worsening the condition.

Predicted Answer: A: Barrett's esophagus is characterized by a change in normal esophageal epithelium to a metaplastic columnar epithelium typically above the gastroesophageal junction. The histopathological hallmark of this condition is an increase in goblet cells which can be identified with special stains, such as Alcian blue/PAS (Periodic acid-Schiff). These metaplastic cells may also include Paneth cells in some cases. However, esophageal varices are vascular dilations that occur in the esophagus and are typically seen in patients suffering from liver cirrhosis; they are not a hallmark of Barrett's esophagus. Red velvet-like mucosa can be consistent with many different pathologies including but not limited to esophagitis. Metaplasia is a change from normal epithelium to abnormal epithelial cells, but it typically occurs in response to chronic irritation or inflammation. In the case of Barrett's esophagus, this metaplastic change would indeed occur in the upper part of the lower esophagus near the junction with the stomach. Therefore, choice B is also a correct answer; however, there are many pathologies which could cause this change making it not as specific as choice A.

The patient's presentation is most consistent with hypokalemia secondary to diuretic use, which his doctor may have prescribed for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. When this man took a diuretic (the likely medicine), he lost potassium ions; consequently, there was an increase in angiotensin II due to decreased sympathetic stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system, which further increased blood pressure and required higher doses of his antihypertensive medication. Thus, one would expect hypokalemia (fatigue) as well as diuresis (constipation), because the patient is losing more fluid than he normally does due to the potassium loss; also, angiotensin II stimulates appetite.

This can be accompanied by headaches (choice A), which are caused from mild dehydration secondary to reduced oral and lacrimal secretions. The drug also increases salivation but decreases secretion in other mucosal membranes. This is why it tastes like "plastic" when first put into one's mouth, a fact that might explain the patient's hesitation about taking his medications orally.

The onset of symptoms is at 2–8 weeks of age. They consist
of non-bilious projectile vomiting (sometimes with blood),becoming progressively more severe and causing a hypochlo-raemic hypokalaemic alkalosis [27]. A delay in the diagnosisleads to serious dehydration.
Predicted Answer: A: Given the clinical presentation of hypovolemic shock (decreased radial pulses, delayed capillary refill, decreased blood pressure), tachycardia, and evidence of alcohol abuse (black specks in the vomitus, distended abdomen from ascites), this patient is most likely experiencing systemic vasodilation. Systemic vascular resistance is typically calculated as mean arterial pressure divided by cardiac output. This patient has hypovolemic shock, a condition that would result in decreased cardiac output, so it is not the best choice here. Fractional tissue oxygen extraction refers to the amount of oxygen delivered to tissues and used by them, rather than overall systemic resistance. Carotid baroreceptor firing activity increases with systemic vasodilation. Cardiac inotropy (the contractility of the heart) would be expected to increase in response to systemic vasodilation, not decrease. The best answer is C.

Vasculitis would present with signs of inflammation along with other symptoms, so it's not the best answer. Homocysteine levels are checked to determine if there is a hyperhomocysteinemia condition, which could be a cause for arterial occlusion; however, this patient has no symptoms that would point toward homocysteinemia as the primary cause of his leg pain, so (B) is not the best answer. Arterial trauma would also present with signs of injury, such as bleeding or deformity in the affected area, so it's not the best answer either.

Predicted Answer: A: The patient's inability to smell common odors (anosmia) along with his hypogonadism and growth failure is suggestive of Kallmann syndrome. Kallmann syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in genes encoding the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), prokineticin receptor 2 (PROKR2), or the one that encodes for an odorant-binding protein called KAL1. The condition is characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in this patient is evident from his inability to smell, delayed growth and development (short stature), and small testes, along with a lack of secondary sexual characteristics, such as facial hair. This question combines several aspects of human development covered in the Endocrine section of the exam: hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, anosmia, cryptorchidism, and short stature.

Predicted Answer: (B)  The schizoaffective disorder is a condition in which there is a combination of symptoms typical for schizophrenia (such as thought and behavior disorganization) along with mood episodes (such as manic or depressive states). Because this patient has had periods where he experienced psychotic symptoms without clear evidence of a mood episode, schizoaffective disorder best fits his presentation. Brief psychotic disorder would not fit because the duration of these events was longer than 1 month. Schizophreniform disorder could be a possibility; however, there have been several periods with symptom-free intervals (e.g., while in class), which is not typical for schizophrenia and its related disorders. The schizotypal personality disorder can occur as an axis II diagnosis. However, it does not fit the context of this question since the individual's symptoms are episodic rather than a continuous pattern. (Kerns & Shultz, 2013)

Predicted Answer: A: The ATP2A1 gene encodes for a sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump that pumps calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum after muscle contraction. Thus, individuals with mutations in this gene will have decreased function of this enzyme and will not be able to adequately pump calcium into their sarcoplasmic reticulum. This results in an increased cytosolic concentration of calcium ions. As a result, muscles can contract quickly but relax slowly because the sarcoplasmic reticulum is unable to rapidly remove calcium from the cytoplasm. Thus, individuals with this rare disease have slower muscle relaxation times and an increased cytosolic concentration of calcium.

Predicted Answer: A: Ulcerative colitis involves a continuous segment of colon extending proximally from the anus, usually limited to the colon itself. It does not involve the terminal ileum, and when the terminal ileum is involved along with ulcerative colitis, this condition is referred to as ulcerative colitis with involvement of the rectum and the terminal (distal) one-third of the ascending colon, which is actually a description of Crohn disease. Noncaseating granulomas are more characteristic of Crohn disease than ulcerative colitis. Transmural inflammation is present in both diseases but is more characteristic of Crohn disease, which often causes fistulas and fissures as well as bowel obstruction due to the transmural nature of its inflammatory process. Continuous mucosal damage is actually a hallmark of ulcerative colitis, particularly when it involves pancolitis. (Choice B) Noncaseating granulomas are not present in ulcerative colitis; they are characteristic of Crohn disease. Choices A and C can be eliminated because involvement of the terminal ileum would suggest Crohn disease rather than ulcerative colitis, which is a continuous segment of colon limited to the colon itself without any significant involvement of the small intestine (choice A). Transmural inflammation is more characteristic of Crohn disease, not ulcerative colitis. Thus, choice C can also be eliminated and choice D, the only option left, is correct because ulcerative colitis is characterized by continuous mucosal damage, most often leading to pancolitis, as opposed to skip lesions that are seen in Crohn disease.

It can cause hypotension, which may be beneficial because this patient’s blood pressure is low, but it does not have a significant depressive effect on respiration or cardiac function. Additionally, propofol does not stimulate the gag reflex and will not interfere with the placement of an endotracheal tube. Midazolam can cause respiratory depression, making it contraindicated in this scenario. Nitrous oxide increases intracranial pressure (ICP) and is also contraindicated in patients with elevated ICP. Sevoflurane has a depressive effect on respiration and cardiac function, making it an inappropriate choice for this patient as well.

The definitive diagnosisof infection is made by appropriate microbiological investi-gations, but hematological and biochemical investigations(Table 116.1) are also informative and will determine therapy.
Predicted Answer: A: This question requires the test-taker to identify the mechanism of action of an antibiotic that would be effective against a gram-negative rod bacterial infection, given the information provided in the stem. The most likely organism responsible for the symptoms described is Escherichia coli (E. coli), which is a common cause of urinary tract infections. The test-taker needs to remember that the mechanism of action of various antibiotics include inhibiting cell wall synthesis (e.g., penicillin, cephalosporins), inhibiting protein synthesis (e.g., tetracyclines), binding D-alanine-D-alanine in the cell wall (e.g., vancomycin), or inhibiting sterol synthesis (e.g., griseofulvin). Given that the patient's symptoms resolved after treatment with an antibiotic, it is most likely that the antibiotic inhibited cell wall synthesis. This reasoning process demonstrates the ability to apply scientific evidence evaluation principles and use clinical knowledge of pathogens and antibiotics to answer a question.

Predicted Answer: A) Chronic airway inflammation typically presents with wheezing and cough, but this patient's symptoms are more indicative of heart failure from amyloidosis.

## Step 1: Identify key symptoms
The patient presents with shortness of breath with mild exertion, progressive weakness, a dry cough that has persisted for 6 months, enlarged fingertips, markedly curved nails, and an irregularly irregular pulse on physical examination.

## Step 2: Consider medication history
The patient is taking warfarin, enalapril, and amiodarone. Warfarin is an anticoagulant, enalapril is an ACE inhibitor used to treat hypertension, and amiodarone is a medication used for treating atrial fibrillation.

## Step 3: Analyze symptoms related to medications
The patient's symptoms such as shortness of breath with mild exertion and progressive weakness could be indicative of heart failure. The use of enalapril suggests that the patient has hypertension, which is a risk factor for heart failure.

## Step 4: Consider CT scan findings
The clustered air spaces and reticular opacities in the basal parts of the lung on the CT scan are more suggestive of interstitial lung disease or heart failure rather than chronic airway inflammation or pleural scarring.

## Step 5: Analyze symptoms related to smoking history
The patient has a long history of smoking, which could be a contributing factor to his respiratory symptoms. However, given the other symptoms and medication history, the most likely underlying mechanism is related to heart failure rather than chronic airway inflammation or bronchial hyperresponsiveness.

## Step 6: Consider clinical findings of enlarged fingertips and curved nails
The patient's physical examination shows enlarged fingertips and markedly curved nails, which are classic signs of amyloidosis. This condition can lead to restrictive lung disease, making it difficult for the heart to pump blood effectively, resulting in heart failure symptoms.

## Step 7: Determine underlying mechanism of dyspnea
Given the patient's history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and symptoms suggestive of heart failure, along with clinical findings consistent with amyloidosis, the most likely underlying mechanism of his dyspnea is excess collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix of the lung.

Predicted Answer: A
Explanation: The prolonged QT interval is a hallmark of bupropion toxicity, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death. Bupropion was the medication the patient had been taking since his initial diagnosis with major depressive disorder 3 years ago (choice D). Sertraline (choice B) would not have produced this ECG finding. Venlafaxine (choice C), although causing a prolonged QT interval, is much less likely to cause cardiac arrest. Clomipramine (choice D) can also lead to a prolonged QT interval but was unlikely to be used alone in the treatment of major depressive disorder; it would probably have been used with another medication. The patient’s condition progressed from coma to death because his ECG showed a 450-millisecond QT interval, an unusual finding for someone only 21 years old. Remember, when two or more medications are combined, side effects will often increase. This is especially true of the medications that cause prolonged QT intervals, as they can be additive in their effect on the heart, increasing the risk of sudden cardiac death.

Predicted Answer: A: The patient's fundal height is greater than expected for her gestational age, indicating possible polyhydramnios. Polyhydramnios can be a sign of fetal abnormalities such as an open neural tube defect (e.g., spina bifida), a facial cleft or amniotic band sequence (which includes amelia). However, the most likely correct answer is A because patients with sacral agenesis and those with spina bifida are more likely to have polyhydramnios, whereas they do not necessarily present with increased fundal height. In contrast, a patient whose fetus has an open facial cleft (including amelia) will also be more likely than the other choices to have both decreased fundal height and decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels (MSAFP). Spina bifida is associated with elevated MSAFP levels in approximately 75% of patients, making it a strong candidate.

Treatment with two antiviral drugs, i.e., interferon (IFN)-α
Predicted Answer: A: Intravenous heroin use is a risk factor for hepatitis C infection. Hepatitis C virus can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Therapy of chronic hepatitis C involves interferon-α (IFN) combined with ribavirin, which inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), thus halting viral replication. Ribavirin is an antiviral drug that has been used for over 50 years to treat a variety of viral infections, including the treatment of acute viral hepatitis and chronic hepatitis C. The mechanism by which ribavirin exerts its effect on virus replication remains incompletely understood; however, it acts as a synthetic nucleoside analog, incorporating into RNA through the action of cellular kinases. Once incorporated, the drug is further phosphorylated to its active form, which inhibits viral replication in two ways: 1) via incorporation into viral RNA, thus causing chain termination and preventing full-length viral messenger RNA from being synthesized; and 2) through inhibition of IMPDH (also called guanine monophosphate dehydrogenase). The IMPDH enzyme is an essential component of the purine synthesis pathway. It catalyzes the oxidation of inosine monophosphate to xanthosine monophosphate, which is necessary for pyrimidine and purine nucleotide biosynthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme results in a decrease in the production of these important cellular components, thereby limiting viral replication. The other options are all incorrect. DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (choice B) is the enzyme involved in transcription of DNA to produce complementary RNA strands. It does not play a role in ribavirin’s mechanism of action or effectiveness in treating hepatitis C infection. DNA gyrase (choice C), also known as topoisomerase II, is an essential component in bacterial chromosome replication. As such, it plays no role in the viral replication of hepatitis C. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (choice D) catalyzes the production of orotic acid from orotidine-5’-phosphate and carbon dioxide. This enzyme is involved in pyrimidine synthesis but has no relation to ribavirin’s effect on hepatitis C virus replication.

Predicted Answer: A: This man has developed malignant catatonia, characterized by immobility, rigidity, and a history of hallucinations. The use of haloperidol likely contributed to his symptoms. His symptoms were also exacerbated by the flexion posture of the neck and the patient's apparent anxiety. The most appropriate therapy for this patient is benztropine (an anticholinergic), which should be given along with dantrolene. Benztropine can help to counteract the excessive muscular rigidity and dystonia that developed after haloperidol was administered. Dantrolene also decreases muscle tone but does not cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore does not have a central nervous system depressant effect, making it ideal for treating malignant catatonia. Baclofen is an agonist at the GABA B receptor and would be more likely to exacerbate his symptoms by depressing the central nervous system further.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient most likely has Guillain-Barré syndrome, as suggested by her ascending weakness, decreased deep tendon reflexes in the upper limbs (the patellar reflex is 4+, suggesting areflexia), and the presence of clonus. The MRI may show increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images in the spinal cord white matter, indicating edema. Guillain-Barré syndrome often occurs as a complication of an infectious process; therefore, it would be expected that she might have evidence of an acute infection (such as pharyngitis) that preceded her symptoms of weakness. Autoantibodies against the cardiolipin-cholesterol-lecithin antigen in serum are associated with Sydenham's chorea, a major criterion for the diagnosis of rheumatic fever. (B) is incorrect because this would suggest progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a serious disease caused by reactivation of polyomavirus in immunocompromised patients.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient's presentation of shortness of breath and findings on exam are consistent with heart failure. With a normal EKG and troponin levels, the shortness of breath in this patient is most likely due to fluid overload leading to pulmonary congestion rather than an acute myocardial infarction. In heart failure patients, the Aa gradient is increased. This is because there is fluid in the lungs (pulmonary congestion) that must be cleared and oxygenated, which requires more time and results in a greater difference between the partial pressures of alveolar gas and arterial blood, leading to an increased Aa gradient. In addition, with fluid overload and pulmonary congestion, the surface area for diffusion is decreased because alveoli are filled with fluid and thus are less able to participate in gas exchange. The diffusion distance, however, remains normal as this value reflects the thickness of the lung tissue itself.

3. A transient systolic murmur due to tricuspid regurgitation
Predicted Answer: A: This patient has a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), which is a common congenital heart defect in premature infants that typically closes within the first week of life. Indomethacin is used to close the PDA by inhibiting prostaglandin E synthetase, thus closing the ductus arteriosus. The infant should be kept upright and not receive any stimuli that may increase blood flow through the ductus arteriosus until the PDA closes.

The use of a thiazide diuretic (choice B) could actually make the PDA worse by decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance, thus increasing the pressure gradient across the PDA. Aspirin also increases PGE levels and would not be appropriate in this case. Penicillin is unnecessary if there are no signs of bacterial endocarditis.

B.  Erythrocytes enzyme mutations
Predicted Answer: A: The clinical presentation of this infant suggests that she has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD-D) based on the presence of anemia and jaundice, which are consistent with a deficiency in this enzyme. G6PD is involved in defending red blood cells against oxidative stress and is also important for the pentose phosphate pathway. The substrate that allosterically inhibits G6PD is glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), but this option is not available. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate allosterically inhibits G6P. Therefore, choice C is correct. G6PD deficiency can be inherited in an X-linked pattern and is more common among African males than females; however, it is more common among African American women since they have two X-chromosomes. This condition results in hemolysis after exposure to certain drugs such as sulfonamides or antimalarial medications (e.g., primaquine), infections, or oxidative stress.

Retrieved Content: com-pensatory mechanisms.42 Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract 265
Predicted Answer: Explanation: C Choice C is correct because enterochromaffin-like cells release histamine, gastrin, and acetylcholine, which are potent stimulators of gastric acid production. The rate of stomach acid secretion at point D in the graph increases significantly above 4 hours postmeal. This increase would be due to a substance that is released after eating (such as gastrin), thus choice C is correct. Vagal stimulation, such as seen with meal ingestion or hypovolemia, stimulates gastric acid production but does not cause the significant increase observed at point D in this graph; therefore, choice A is incorrect. The release of secretin and other hormones involved in intestinal phase response to food (choice B) would be expected to decrease gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the release of gastrin and histamine. The I cells of the small intestine are primarily responsible for releasing cholecystokinin, which stimulates gallbladder contraction and pancreatic enzyme secretion but does not directly stimulate stomach acid production; therefore, choice D is incorrect.

130.7.2 Intraventricular Hemorrhage (IVH)
Predicted Answer: A: The patient's history and examination findings are classic for a stroke, specifically a lacunar infarct. Lacunar strokes typically result from small vessel disease and affect structures in the internal capsule or its related tracts; they can cause either motor (the most common) or sensory syndromes that correspond to specific tracts. Because this patient's sensory symptoms are on the opposite side of his body than the face, he probably has a infarct affecting the posterior limb of the internal capsule (A), which carries crossed (or "decussating") fibers from the right side of the brain to the left side of the spinal cord. A lesion in this location would result in contralateral sensory symptoms and no motor deficits. The other options can be eliminated based on their typical presentations: lesions in the lateral medulla (B) cause Wallenberg syndrome, which includes dysphagia, hoarseness, and a Horner's sign ipsilaterally along with decreased sensation to light touch on the face contralateral to the lesion; those of the basal pons (C) are known as Millard-Gubler syndrome, which presents with contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and an ipsilateral facial weakness; and lesions in the ventral thalamus (D) present with a Thalamic Syndrome, which includes confusion, altered mental status, hemisensory symptoms, and rarely, hemiparesis.

Predicted Answer: A: The photomicrograph in this question shows eosinophils. Eosinophils are often associated with asthma and parasitic infections; they are less commonly seen in pneumonia. However, during the acute phase of an inflammatory response like that seen in pneumonia, these cells may infiltrate into lung tissue as well. Leukotriene D4 is a potent chemotactic agent for eosinophils, among other cell types, making it the most likely mediator present in this case. (A) Platelet activating factor is also an inflammatory mediator, but its actions do not include inducing the infiltration of eosinophils into tissues. Thus, choice A is incorrect. Interferon-gamma stimulates the production of tumor necrosis factor and can induce the activation of macrophages; however, it does not promote eosinophil infiltration in lung tissue. Choice B is also incorrect. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) suppresses inflammation. Thus, choice C is incorrect. (Note: It may take a little practice to distinguish between these similar-sounding terms.)

Predicted Answer: A: Child abuse should be suspected in any infant who has suffered a fracture (especially those difficult to explain by accident) or other traumatic injury not consistent with an accidental event. The best initial step is a thorough medical evaluation of the child for any potential serious, life-threatening injuries and also the rule out of any underlying medical conditions that might contribute to the child's presentation. The most important medical consideration in this case would be rhabdomyolysis or other traumatic head injury.

Predicted Answer: A: This study is a classic example of a parallel group randomized controlled trial, which is a type of clinical trial where participants are divided into multiple treatment arms, but each patient receives just one intervention.

(Choice B) A factorial design study involves testing two or more interventions within the same arm and then combining them in all possible ways. This would not be an example of that type of study because there are only 2 treatments being tested against each other and not in combination with a third treatment.

(Choice C) The correct term for this is actually "within patient," where participants are divided into several different arms, but they receive more than one intervention within the same arm. This would be an example of that type of study if patients were divided up and received all of these treatments as part of their experimental design.

(Choice D) A cluster randomized trial is a type of trial where groups of individuals (such as hospitals or physicians' offices) are randomly assigned to one treatment versus another. The patients within the same group then receive the same intervention. This would not be an example of that type of study because individual patients were randomized into the different arms, and not the groups themselves.

Predicted Answer: A: This question requires a knowledge of inborn errors of metabolism and specifically hyperammonemia that occurs at birth. The key findings in this patient are high levels of ammonia and orotic acid, which points toward a urea cycle disorder. Urea cycle disorders cause the accumulation of ammonia and other intermediates. In particular, a deficiency of the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I leads to an accumulation of ammonia (hyperammonemia), as well as an intermediate of pyrimidine synthesis named orotic acid. This is because the carbamoyl phosphate produced by this enzyme would normally be diverted into the urea cycle; instead, it feeds into the pyrimidine synthesis pathway and results in elevated levels of orotic acid. Therefore, answer A is correct.

Predicted Answer: A: The most likely diagnosis is ankylosing spondylitis (AS), which can present in multiple forms and often affects younger men. Systemic symptoms include acute anterior uveitis, as seen in this patient's redness of the eyes and pain on eye movement; elevated inflammatory markers are common with AS. Dry mouth (A) might be associated with Sjögren syndrome or some cases of primary biliary cirrhosis. Malabsorption is more characteristic of chronic pancreatitis, celiac disease, or other diseases affecting the small intestine, which can also cause back pain and inflammation. Aortic regurgitation would most likely be seen in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis complicated by cardiovascular calcification (and thus not an appropriate answer choice). Hemochromatosis can mimic AS but is unlikely to present in young males in the same way as described.

Explanation: This patient likely has variant angina, also known as Prinzmetal’s angina. Variant angina is a type of chest pain caused by transient vasospasm of coronary arteries leading to temporary ischemia of the myocardium. The symptoms are usually sudden onset, short duration (typically lasting 1–10 minutes), and resolve spontaneously, which fits this patient’s presentation. Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that helps prevent thrombus formation in the setting of vaso-occlusion. Heparin, beta-blockers like propranolol, and nitroglycerine can reduce cardiac workload and myocardial oxygen demand but are not first-line treatments for vasospasm. Isosorbide dinitrate is a nitric oxide donor that relaxes vascular smooth muscle cells in the heart but is typically used as a supplement to beta-blockers.

Reasoning Skill for Scientific Evidence Evaluation:

This question requires the application of clinical knowledge and laboratory results to determine the underlying cause of a patient's condition. The key findings are:

1. Yellow sclerae, severe lethargy, and decreased muscle tone in a one-week-old boy.
2. Elevated bilirubin levels with almost exclusively unconjugated bilirubin.
3. Normal liver function tests except for slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase.

The high level of unconjugated bilirubin suggests a problem with conjugation, which is the process by which bilirubin is converted from its fat-soluble form to its water-soluble form. This conversion is mediated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1 (UGT1A1). A deficiency or absence of this enzyme would lead to a buildup of unconjugated bilirubin, causing jaundice and potentially kernicterus.

The correct answer, A, reflects the absence of UGT1A1, which is consistent with the clinical presentation. The other options are not supported by the laboratory results:

B: An alteration in the ankyrin protein would affect red blood cell membrane structure and lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn, which is not indicated by the provided lab values.

C: A reduction in UGT1A1 activity could also cause elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels, but it does not as strongly suggest a genetic defect or absence of the enzyme.

D: A deficiency in glucocerebrosidase would lead to Gaucher's disease, which presents differently and is not indicated by the provided lab values.

Predicted Answer: A) This patient’s presentation of chest pain radiating to the back, weak distal pulses, and a physical exam note stating that he is tall with joint hypermobility are suggestive of aortic dissection. The patient’s blood pressure is 94/56 mmHg, indicating hypotension consistent with a massive aortic dissection. This type of injury can occur when a tear in the intima propagates into the media layer and disrupts the vasa vasorum, leading to an inability for the aorta to maintain its luminal diameter. The tearing sound associated with this condition is often described as sounding like the ripping of a tire or being similar to a cannon shot. A patient with a Marfan syndrome would be at increased risk of developing this diagnosis due to his tall stature and joint hypermobility, which are suggestive findings in patients with Marfan syndrome.

Bisphosphoglycerate mutase, on the other hand, catalyzes the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GADP). The 1,3-BPG molecule has an affinity for hemoglobin, which is why bisphosphoglycerate mutase is known as a "hemoglobin shunt."

Predicted Answer: A: The patient has agoraphobia, which is an anxiety disorder that is characterized by a fear of situations where the person might feel trapped and be unable to escape, such as on public transportation or in crowds. The most common manifestation of this condition is avoidance behavior, because it allows individuals with this disorder to avoid potentially overwhelming experiences. The DSM-5 criteria for agoraphobia includes being fearful of at least two different situations in which escape might be difficult or embarrassing. (B) is incorrect because the duration can be less than a month. (C) is incorrect because the patient needs to show a fear or avoidance behavior toward two types of situations. The third criterion for agoraphobia involves noting that these fears are not better accounted for by fear of being in public places and social interactions (i.e., social phobia).

* Data from 49 infants. Reproduced from [40] with permission.
Predicted Answer: A
Explanation:
The irregularly irregular heart rhythm observed in this patient is indicative of atrial fibrillation (AF). The effect of digoxin in this patient would be most consistent with increased ventricular contractility (D), as it increases the force of contraction and decreases the rate of contractions. While beta-adrenergic blockade, vagal stimulation, or calcium channel blockade may decrease heart rate, none are directly associated with the use of digoxin for AF. (Note: Digoxin would not be used to treat AF; however, it is sometimes used to control ventricular rate in patients who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy.)

Predicted Answer: A: The partial thromboplastin time is a measure of how well factors in the intrinsic and common coagulation pathways work together. This patient's PTT is significantly prolonged at 53 seconds; the normal range is generally considered to be between 25 and 35 seconds. Factor XII, which has a half-life of about 72 hours, leads off the intrinsic pathway, while factor VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, II (prothrombin), V, IV, III, I (fibrinogen), XIII lead off the common coagulation pathway. This patient's PTT is significantly prolonged, making option D the correct answer. Factor XII deficiency will result in a prolongation of the PTT because the intrinsic and/or common pathways can't be activated properly. The bleeding time would only measure issues with platelets in the vascular system outside of blood vessels. Prothrombin time (PT) measures how well factors for the extrinsic pathway, I, II, V, VII, and X work together; this patient's PT is normal at 11 seconds. The coagulation tests are not consistent with any other factor deficiency or problem except factor XII deficiency, so option D is correct.

The first child’s description is consistent with a normal 2-month-old infant. This age corresponds with reflexes that include lifting his head and chest in the prone position, tracking an object with his eyes to the midline, and having fists about 50% of the time. At this stage, infants also void at least eight times per day and have yellow stools without straining.

The second child’s behavior is consistent with a normal 4-month-old infant, who can roll from supine to prone but not yet say words. At 6 months, children should be able to transfer toys from one hand to the other and babble with consonant-vowel combinations. The third child’s ability to take steps independently indicates an age of at least 12 months.

(Choice A) Six weeks is too early for these behaviors. (Choice C) Six months is too young for a child who can take independent steps. At this age, they can just stand with support.

Predicted Answer: A: The patient’s laboratory test results and physical examination suggest that she has a hemolytic anemia characterized by normocytic hypochromic anemia (as indicated by a low MCV and a low MCHC), elevated indirect bilirubin levels, splenomegaly, and spherocytes on her peripheral blood smear. The lack of evidence for antibodies in the patient’s serum as indicated by the negative Coombs test makes it less likely that this patient has an autoimmune form of hemolytic anemia (e.g., warm or cold antibody-induced anemia). However, the presence of spherocytes can be seen in both hereditary and acquired forms of hemolytic anemia. The flow cytometry for CD55/CD59 would be appropriate to confirm a diagnosis of PNH which is characterized by the absence of certain glycoproteins on the surface of RBCs and is associated with acute hemolysis, pancytopenia, and often kidney disease. While there are other diagnostic tests that could also help identify this patient’s underlying disorder (e.g., DNA-based testing for PNH, the acetylcholine-binding assay), flow cytometry would be most appropriate of all those listed in this question.

Raloxifene is used for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, especially those with prior invasive breast cancer. Raloxifene also decreases the risk of vertebral fractures by 30% compared to placebo. However, it may increase the risk of deep vein thrombophlebitis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism. This condition is similar to the increased risk seen with tamoxifen and estrogen replacement therapy. Raloxifene may also exacerbate gallstones. The patient has hypertension for which she takes ramipril, an ACE inhibitor, and not a calcium channel blocker such as verapamil, which would be used in conjunction with raloxifene to reduce the risk of DVT. Thus, this patient's increased risk is that of pulmonary embolism, making (A) correct. Raloxifene does cause an increase in the rate of venous thrombosis. Menopause was at age 55, and she has hypertension for which she takes ramipril. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at the femoral neck shows a T-score of -2.7 SD.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient has a condition known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH), which is characterized by a normal uterus and ovaries but absent development of the vagina and cervix. MRKH occurs in 1 in every 4,000 to 50,000 females and typically involves both sides of the pelvis. It is usually diagnosed at or before puberty. The lack of menstruation, absence of the vagina, and presence of normal secondary sexual characteristics are consistent with a diagnosis of MRKH. Choice A, 5-α reductase deficiency, would result in an individual who appears phenotypically male but has the ability to produce estrogen (and have some degree of feminization) despite having XY sex chromosomes. This condition is characterized by an inability to metabolize androgens into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), so there is a decrease in virilization at puberty, with ambiguous external genitalia and a blind vaginal pouch. Choice B, sex chromosome mosaicism, would result in an individual with a mixture of X and Y chromosomes who are phenotypically female but have some degree of masculinization because of the presence of Y chromosome–bearing cells.

Predicted Answer: A
Explanation: The partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is a measure of how quickly the intrinsic pathway generates thrombin from fibrinogen. As such, any factor within this pathway will prolong or shorten PTT. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis often involves heparin. Heparin works by activating antithrombin III. Antithrombin III shortens PTT because it inhibits factors in the intrinsic pathway (factors IIa [thrombin], Xa, IXa, VIIIa, XIa, and XIIa). Therefore, any factor in this pathway is likely to be shortened when heparin therapy is initiated.

Explanation: The patient in this question appears to have community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), given his respiratory symptoms and crackles on physical exam. CAP is a leading cause of illness and death among older adults. A significant body of research has shown that, for patients who are hospitalized with CAP, the use of azithromycin (Zithromax) decreases in-hospital mortality. The 2009 Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines recommend using azithromycin as part of the treatment regimen for CAP. However, there is no evidence that routine use of a second antibiotic (such as moxifloxacin) provides any benefit to this patient, as he appears stable on physical exam with adequate oxygenation. His blood pressure and pulse rate are somewhat low and high respectively but these findings do not indicate hemodynamic instability. Thus, the best choice is A.

This condition has multiple potential causes, but given the recent history of severe sore throat and fever, the most likely diagnosis would be a hypersensitivity reaction to a specific bacterial or viral infection. The patient's symptoms started 3 days after his initial febrile illness which resolved without treatment, suggesting an allergic response to his previous illness. Therefore, obtaining a throat culture is appropriate as it will help determine if the sore throat was caused by Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), which can lead to poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis or rheumatic fever.

These symptoms suggest hepatic encephalopathy (HE), which is characterized by a spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities, ranging from mild confusion to coma, caused by liver dysfunction and subsequent portosystemic shunting that leads to the accumulation of neurotoxic substances such as ammonia in the blood. This patient's history of alcoholic cirrhosis and recent TIPS placement increases her risk for HE. Reversal of TIPS may be considered when the symptoms are severe or unresponsive to standard therapy but would not be the immediate next step, which is to manage hepatic encephalopathy. The most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition is administering lactulose because it acts as a cathartic to absorb ammonia and decrease its absorption into the bloodstream.

Predicted Answer: A: The splenic artery originates from the celiac trunk and gives off the short gastric arteries and the left gastroepiploic artery. It also supplies branches directly to the spleen. Ligation of this artery would not affect the stomach or liver, but it would lead to hypoperfusion of the spleen itself (because all its arterial supply is now being cut), and of the short gastric arteries and the left gastroepiploic artery since they arise from the ligated splenic artery. The left gastric artery arises directly from the celiac trunk and therefore would not be affected by ligation of the splenic artery at its origin.

This patient has a 2-year history of regular menses and no abnormalities noted on pelvic examination. She also does not have any symptoms of an acute sexually transmitted infection. Her age is not relevant as the guidelines for Pap smear screening are based on age, not years since the last exam. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that women in their 20s receive a Pap smear every 3 years.
Note: Other options were considered incorrect. This patient has had no abnormal results from her previous screening (ie, Pap smear at age 22) as well as no symptoms that would necessitate a repeat Pap smear at this time. Her routine immunizations have been maintained and she is not due for any additional vaccines, making option A incorrect.

The edema and the kidney biopsy findings in PSGN are consistent with an inflammatory process affecting the renal glomeruli. Hyaline casts on urinalysis, while not pathognomonic for PSGN, would be suggestive of a glomerulonephritis rather than a nephrotic syndrome, as seen in minimal change disease (choice B). The presence of immunoglobulin and complement fragments (such as C3) can often be found in the serum but not on urinalysis. White blood cell casts (choice C) would be suggestive of an interstitial process such as pyelonephritis or acute tubulointerstitial nephropathy, whereas granular casts and tubular epithelial cells (choice D), along with the presence of hematuria, are seen in conditions that affect the renal tubules.

Predicted Answer: A: Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21; it has been estimated that Down syndrome occurs in approximately one per 700 live births. As part of its diagnostic criteria, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) lists upslanting palpebral fissures as a criterion for the diagnosis of Down syndrome. The presence of this feature in combination with epicanthal folds and hypotonia should prompt the pediatrician to investigate further for the possibility of an extra copy of chromosome 21 or other genetic abnormalities, such as Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) which also occurs more frequently than most obstetricians are aware.

Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA) is similar but has more widespread rash, fever, and leukocytosis. A variation of PLEVA is called KAWASAKI disease when it involves the skin lesions associated with a febrile illness like scarlet fever.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient’s symptoms are likely caused by tissue-specific differences in expression of sorbitol dehydrogenase. Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes and is typically associated with microaneurysms and narrowing of the retinal arteries, as seen on this patient’s fundoscopic examination. In patients with diabetic retinopathy, there are elevated levels of glucose in the blood that lead to the accumulation of sorbitol within cells due to the increased activity of the enzyme aldose reductase. This increase in intracellular sorbitol can then stimulate the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase. It is the conversion of sorbitol into fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase that leads to cellular damage seen in diabetic retinopathy, including microaneurysms and narrowing of the retinal arteries, due to increased osmotic pressure within cells.

Explanation: A patient with bipolar disorder should be informed that pregnancy might necessitate changing her medication regimen. This patient is being managed on lithium, which increases the risk of cleft palate and other cardiac anomalies by 20%. Lithium can also increase the risk of premature delivery and low birth weight; however, it does not seem to impact long-term cognitive development in offspring of bipolar patients. Patients being treated for bipolar disorder are generally prescribed either a mood stabilizer (e.g., valproate, lithium) or an antipsychotic agent. Lithium is preferred when there are comorbid indications such as substance abuse and history of suicidal ideation because it tends to discourage such behaviors in the patient, thereby lowering their overall risk. A lower dose throughout pregnancy may be safer than full doses given during first trimester. This is because medications that work on mood stabilizers can have a higher teratogenic potential (e.g., valproate). B and C are incorrect because taking daily folic acid of 0.4 to 1mg will prevent birth defects of the neural tube, but it will not affect the risk of medication-induced birth defects such as those from valproate or lithium, which is used in treating bipolar I disorder. A low-dose polytherapy (C) is not preferred over monotherapy when a patient is being managed for mood stabilizers; a single medication with fewer side effects and less teratogenic potential would be more effective.

Predicted Answer: A: The end-diastolic volume (EDV) is calculated as follows: EDV = cardiac output divided by heart rate in beats per minute. In this patient, assuming a heart rate of 100 beats/min and cardiac output of approximately 5 L/min (which is the average for an adult), his end-diastolic volume would be approximately 50 mL. His ejection fraction (EF) can then be calculated as follows: EF = EDV − ESV ÷ EDV, or 80 ÷ 50, which equals 0.16, or 16%. The ejection fraction is therefore low at approximately 16% or less than a normal level of about 25 to 30 percent.

Predicted Answer: A: The cardiotocograph shows fetal bradycardia (a heart rate < 110 bpm) and variable decelerations after cervical dilatation of more than 5 cm. These findings are suggestive of possible umbilical cord compression, which may be due to prolapse or entanglement of the cord around the baby's neck. The most appropriate initial management is repositioning (D), as this maneuver has been shown to resolve fetal distress in some cases. Amnioinfusion and induced vaginal delivery might be considered if repositioning fails. However, considering her 100% effacement and 10 cm dilation, immediate induction of a vaginal delivery is inappropriate.

Predicted Answer: A
Explanation: The patient has symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which would be expected based on his history of smoking and age. The decreased breath sounds are due to the decreased lung volume that is present in COPD, which also explains the increased chest diameter and hyperresonance on percussion. Both residual volume (RV) and forced expiratory volume (FEV1) are used as measures of lung function. RV is a measure of how much air can be held at the end of expiration after maximum effort has been made to exhale, while FEV1 is the amount of air that can be expelled from the lungs in one second. In COPD patients the loss of elastic recoil due to inflammation and obstruction results in an increased RV, but a decreased FEV1. Thus, (A) is correct. (B) is incorrect because in COPD, there would be an increase in RV, not a decrease. While FEV1 would decrease, residual volume (RV) would increase. Both are decreased in (C), which makes it wrong as well. In addition, FEV1 is decreased while RV is increased with COPD. Normal RV but decreased FEV1 makes (D) incorrect because RV should be increased.

Predicted Answer: A: This woman's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome. The increased urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration is suggestive of this condition as well. The findings most likely associated with carcinoid syndrome are achlorhydria (due to gastric antral vascular ectasias and fibrosis caused by the tumor), which would make option A correct. Carcinoid syndrome often leads to heart valvular abnormalities (such as pulmonic stenosis) due to systemic fibrosis of the valve tissue, making option D incorrect. The symptoms described in this patient could be related to a variety of other conditions as well, but they are most closely associated with carcinoid syndrome. A patient suspected of having carcinoid syndrome should undergo an upper GI endoscopy and/or small bowel follow-through study because the tumor is often located within the stomach or small intestine. If these findings indicate that this woman has a gastric or intestinal carcinoid, it would not be necessary to further evaluate her for option B (adrenal medullary mass). Carcinoids of the lung are generally associated with other systemic symptoms and should be considered in patients with pulmonary nodules. This would not change the most likely answer from A. Option C is incorrect because this patient does not have the typical "coffee ground" hematemesis that would indicate peptic ulcers as a possible diagnosis.

A heart murmur that worsens over time is indicative of an acute bacterial endocarditis. Streptococcus bovis is associated with colorectal cancer and would be a likely choice, except that this patient's recent colonoscopy showed a lesion suggestive of cancer but not a definitive diagnosis.

Predicted Answer: A
Explanation: The patient’s high expiratory flow rates when corrected for lung volume can be attributed to the fact that the anatomical dead space of his lungs has been decreased due to emphysema. This would cause a higher than normal flow rate when measured on spirometry. (Choice B) Pulmonary compliance is defined as the change in lung volume per unit increase in pressure and would not directly affect flow rates. The physical findings described are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema being one form of COPD. In addition to decreased anatomical dead space, patients suffering from emphysema exhibit hyperinflation of alveoli which can lead to a reduction in the total lung volume. Patients will then breathe faster than normal to compensate for the reduced volume, further increasing flow rates (choice C). Small airway wall thickness is anatomic characteristic seen in COPD and would result in increased resistance but not increased flow rates (choice D).

Predicted Answer: A: The infant most likely has neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) caused by maternal opiate use. The mother's codeine syrup is a key clue to this diagnosis. A complete blood count and serum levels of glucose, bilirubin, and calcium are normal, making B incorrect. The infant does not have an infection and does not need antibiotics, eliminating choice C as well. Because the baby is not feeding well and has signs of hyperactivity (hyperreflexia, tremors), this suggests withdrawal from maternal opioids. Oral morphine therapy is the treatment for NAS; thus A is correct. Dextrose infusion would be given if the infant were hypoglycemic, which was ruled out.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in a burn patient occurs most frequently due to gastric mucosal ischemia from decreased prostaglandin synthesis and is known as "stress ulcer disease." This condition results from the systemic inflammatory response syndrome that follows major burns, leading to the release of numerous cytokines. These cytokines inhibit the production of protective prostaglandins in the stomach lining, which leads to erosion of gastric mucosa and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Predicted Answer: A: The child described is most likely a newborn with DiGeorge syndrome. The mother was treated for schizophrenia and alcohol abuse disorder in her past; neither condition would be associated with an increased risk of this birth defect. DiGeorge syndrome (also known as 22q11 deletion syndrome) is characterized by cardiac anomalies, micrognathia, broad nasal bridge, short philtrum, small low-set ears, cleft palate, and other malformations. The murmur heard over the left sternal border is most likely associated with an overriding aorta (tetralogy of Fallot or truncus arteriosus), as suggested by the echocardiogram showing "a single overriding great vessel arising from the heart." The deletion that occurs in DiGeorge syndrome affects genes on chromosome 22. Some individuals with this syndrome also have hypocalcemia due to parathyroid gland aplasia or dysfunction and low levels of PTH in serum (choice A). Hypoplasia of other structures, such as the thymus (leading to an increased risk of serious infections), kidneys, palate, and external ear cartilages may also occur. The child will most likely have feeding difficulties, hypocalcemia (which requires treatment to prevent complications from tetany), recurrent infections, cleft palate, and a cardiac anomaly. In addition to the findings described in this scenario, other possible findings include a bifid uvula, low-set ears, micrognathia, broad nasal bridge, short philtrum, delayed speech development, behavioral difficulties, learning disabilities, hypocalcemia, immunodeficiency (due to thymic aplasia), and cardiac anomalies.

Choriocarcinomas are composed of highly malignant cytotrophoblasts and syncyotrophoblasts that stain positive for hCG, which was not elevated in this patient's case. Teratomas may contain any of the three primary germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm) but rarely involve the testis. They are usually diagnosed by ultrasound or CT and contain a mix of tissues such as hair, teeth, muscle, etc. Yolk sac tumors, also known as endodermal sinus tumors, contain Schiller-Duval bodies and typically have high levels of AFP (alpha-fetoprotein).

Predicted Answer: A: The clinical description provided is most consistent with an anterior dislocation of the shoulder (also known as a traumatic subcoracoid dislocation), where the humeral head reduces below the coracoid process and can be palpated in this location. Sensory innervation to the skin above the clavicle comes from the C3-C4 spinal nerves, which are unlikely to be affected by this injury given that it is primarily an axonal injury affecting the musculotendinous structures of the shoulder (supraspinatus and other rotator cuff muscles) with nerve function intact. The lateral aspect of the shoulder is innervated by nerves arising from the C5 spinal segment, including the superior branch of the axillary nerve. Therefore options B and C are incorrect. The medial aspect of the upper arm receives its sensory innervation primarily from branches of the radial nerve, which originate from the C5-C7 spinal segments, making A an unlikely choice. The dorsal aspect of the forearm and hand is supplied by branches of the musculocutaneous and radial nerves (C5-C8), and this distribution pattern makes D the correct answer.

Predicted Answer: A: The child described in this question is likely suffering from Tay-Sachs disease, a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of β-galactosidase, an enzyme involved in the breakdown of certain lipids in cells. Patients with Tay-Sachs disease often exhibit aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, intellectual disability, and other features listed in the question stem. The disease is usually fatal by age 4 or 5. Because the patient lacks this enzyme, it will not be able to break down a number of substances, including galactocerebroside. As a result, they will accumulate in cells. Therefore, (B) is correct and (A) is incorrect. Heparan sulfate deficiency leads to mucopolysaccharidosis IX (MPS IX), and sphingomyelin accumulation causes Niemann-Pick disease; in neither case does the patient's symptomatology match that described in the question stem. The answer could also be found by elimination because the child described is not a good candidate for either of these diseases, as indicated by the description in the question stem of his coarse facies and short stature, both symptoms not typically seen in MPS IX or Niemann-Pick disease. Heparan sulfate is indeed a glycosaminoglycan (GAG), but it was eliminated based on the process described above. Therefore, this option can also be eliminated.

Predicted Answer: A: This question requires the investigator to have knowledge of the normal distribution and the z-score formula. The appropriate choice can be determined by determining how many standard errors (SE) are between the mean hemoglobin concentration and 18 g/dL, that is: 17 + (1 * 0.1) = 17.1 g/dL 17 + (2 * 0.1) = 17.2 g/dL 17 + (3 * 0.1) = 17.3 g/dL 17 + (4 * 0.1) = 17.4 g/dL 18 g/dL is between 17.3 and 17.4 g/dL, which are three standard errors above the mean concentration of 17 g/dL. Therefore, the z-score for this choice would be 3. Using a z-table or calculator, it can be determined that the area to the right of this value is approximately 99.9%. Choice A is incorrect because only about 16% (1/6) of the distribution lies between the mean and one standard error above the mean. Likewise, choice B is incorrect since only 2% of the distribution (twice the area from z = -2 to z = 0) would lie above two standard errors above the mean. Choice C is incorrect because about 97.7% of the normal curve lies below a z-score of ±2 and about 99.9% lies between -2.5 and +2.5.

One classification of thrombocytopenia is based on the
timing of onset: early (≤ 72 hours of life) vslate (> 72 hours).
Predicted Answer: A: Using the formula for a drug given every h , where T = dose/[( CL / F ) × k ] and k =  ln (2)/ t 1/2, we can solve this problem by first calculating k . k  = [0.693/2 hours] 1 hour - 1  = 0.3456 per hour Next, calculate the clearance: Clearance ( CL ) is equal to Vd × k , where the volume of distribution equals the amount of drug present in the body divided by the plasma concentration. Therefore, Vd  = 15 mg/L ×14.3 L  = 215 mg/L This makes the clearance, which is a measure of how much of this drug can be eliminated per hour, approximately equal to 75 mL/hour (215 mg/L × 0.3456/hour). Since the bioavailability equals 50%, we must multiply the dose by .5 or divide the clearance by .5 in order to find the maintenance dose: Dose = [( CL / F )× k ] = [75 mL/h × 0.5] × 0.3456 per hour ≈ 13 mg/hour Since the patient receives the drug every 8 hours, we must multiply this by 8 (the amount of time that has elapsed since the last dose) to find the dose required for the next dose: Dose = 13 mg/hour × 8 hours = 104 mg. To determine how much this should be rounded to as a final answer we simply have to remember what is being asked: the maintenance dose every 8 hours that will achieve an average plasma concentration of 15 mg/L over time. The actual plasma concentration after a single dose of the drug will exceed this, as it always does with most drugs. Since the patient receives the drug every 8 hours, we can use the formula for calculating a steady-state peak and trough level ( Pmax , Ptmin ): Pmax = Dose/[( CL / F )× k ] and Ptmin = ( Dose /[( CL / F )× k ]) × [(1/2) k -1]( e ) If the plasma concentration is 15 mg/L, we want to determine the dose that must be given in order for this average concentration to equal 15 mg/L. Using Ptmin , which assumes that the amount of drug has decreased by half from its peak value when the patient receives the next dose (thus Pmin = Dose /[( CL / F )× k ](1/2) k -1]), and using a peak:trough ratio of 1:0.582, we can solve for the desired plasma concentration, which in this case will be equal to 15 mg/L. Thus, Pmin = ( Dose /[( CL / F )× k ]) × ( e ) = 15 mg/L Therefore, Pmin = (13 mg/hour)×(1/2)0.3456 per hour - 1  = 5.9 mg/L Therefore, for the patient to have a plasma concentration of 15 mg/L, we must determine how much higher that dose should be than 104 mg. We can solve this by realizing that the amount required will equal ( Pmin / Ptmax ) × Dose . The peak:trough ratio is approximately equal to 1:0.582. Therefore, Ptmax ≈ 17.3 mg/L Thus, Pmin / Ptmax = 5.9 mg/L/17.3 mg/L = 0.34, which means that the dose should be increased by a factor of (0.34) or approximately 2.4-fold above the actual maintenance dose needed to produce an average plasma concentration of 15 mg/L: Dose 150 milligrams

Predicted Answer: A: Because this patient is lethargic, has dry mucous membranes, and vomited in addition to having hepatomegaly, it would be reasonable to suspect that he developed hepatic encephalopathy secondary to acetaminophen (Tylenol) overdose. The mechanism of action for acetaminophen is through its metabolism by the cytochrome P450 system within the liver, producing a toxic metabolite that damages hepatocytes and potentially causes death if there are severe liver effects (as seen in this patient). This would also likely affect the kidneys because it can cause a decrease in GFR secondary to its effect on renal blood flow. The mechanism of acetaminophen's effect on renal function is not clearly understood but could be due to decreased perfusion or a direct toxic effect on renal tubular cells. It appears that the effects on kidney function would include constriction of an afferent arteriole, which decreases GFR and subsequent urine production.

Predicted Answer: A: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant women at 24-28 weeks' gestation be screened for gestational diabetes mellitus by an oral glucose challenge test using a solution containing 50 g of glucose. This woman is due to have her next prenatal visit at 26 weeks, so screening for gestational diabetes should be initiated then. B and C are incorrect because cardiotocography (also known as nonstress testing) is not yet indicated for this patient; it would typically begin around the 28th week of pregnancy. C can be eliminated based on her Pap smear was normal two years ago, so screening for GBS at this visit is not needed. D is also incorrect because Tdap vaccination typically takes place between the 27th and 36th weeks of gestation or earlier if she hasn't had it in a year.

Retrieved Content: Biochemical/hormonal MeasurementsFirst check blood glucose levels. If there is severe or symp-tomatic hypoglycaemia, the levels of GH, cortisol and ACTHshould be measured. If found to be high because of stress(e.g., difficult venous cannulation), then pituitary functiontests may be avoided.
Predicted Answer: A: The patient likely has Cushing's syndrome due to a pituitary adenoma. In this condition, there will be hypersecretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), resulting in increased cortisol production. A dexamethasone suppression test is then performed with two different doses of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. The low-dose portion is 0.5 mg and has a negative feedback effect on ACTH secretion; in patients with Cushing's syndrome, there will be an increase in ACTH because cortisol production is not being suppressed by normal physiological mechanisms. If the patient had Nelson's syndrome (another pituitary adenoma), the dexamethasone suppression test results would be different from those of a typical patient with Cushing's disease and therefore must be eliminated as a possible answer choice. In Nelson's syndrome, there will be increased ACTH due to decreased cortisol feedback on the remaining pituitary gland; however, this condition can be distinguished from Cushing's disease by the low-dose portion of the dexamethasone suppression test (because it shows some degree of suppression). Eliminate answer choice A because patients with Nelson's syndrome would show a decrease in ACTH. For a patient with adrenocortical carcinoma, there will also be increased cortisol production and therefore an increase in ACTH; however, this condition can be distinguished from Cushing's disease by the high-dose portion of the dexamethasone suppression test (because it shows no change). Eliminate answer choice B because patients with Nelson's syndrome would show a decrease in ACTH. This leaves choices C and D as possible answers. For a patient with Cushing's syndrome due to adrenal hyperplasia, there will be increased cortisol production and therefore an increase in ACTH; however, this condition can be distinguished from Cushing's disease by the low-dose portion of the dexamethasone suppression test (because it shows some degree of suppression). Eliminate answer choice D because patients with Nelson's syndrome would show a decrease in ACTH. This leaves answer choice C as the only remaining possibility for which the patient most likely has Nelson's syndrome.

Predicted Answer: A: The patient described in this question has a clinical presentation that is typical of calcific tendinitis, which was once called "tendinitis of adults." This condition typically develops over several days to weeks in young adults and can be characterized by pain at the back of the ankle due to inflammation of the Achilles tendon (tendinitis) accompanied by the formation of a firm, 1-3-cm, skin-colored nodule that moves with the tendon. The photomicrograph from a biopsy of the nodule shows calcification and inflammatory cells. Serum studies in patients with this condition are most likely to show increased levels of rheumatoid factor (A) because this entity is associated with an autoimmune response against the affected tissues (tendinitis). Rheumatoid factor is also found in RA; however, the two conditions can be distinguished by their clinical presentation and other laboratory studies. Although serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels are often used as a marker for sarcoidosis, they may also increase with inflammatory responses (such as that seen in tendinitis). Serum LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels are usually not affected in patients with calcific tendinitis.

It often presents in people >70 years old with symptoms like jaw claudication, visual disturbances, and scalp tenderness. Temporal artery biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis. However, a significant minority of patients will not have abnormalities detected by this test (false negatives). GCA has serious complications if left untreated or undertreated, especially visual loss. Therefore, immediate treatment with high-dose steroids should be initiated as soon as possible. The patient's condition puts her at greatest risk of developing pulmonary hypertension because the disease affects the medium- and large-sized arteries, which can lead to changes in the lung vasculature (e.g., vasculitis) that result in this complication.

Predicted Answer: A: The best next step for this patient is trial of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) given her presentation and lack of systemic symptoms like weight loss, changes in bowel or bladder habits, or pelvic tenderness. NSAIDs are first-line treatment for dysmenorrhea. In addition to NSAIDs, education about the importance of not smoking, keeping regular periods with hormonal contraception, using a heating pad before cramps start, and exercising regularly may also be beneficial. A pelvic ultrasound is not necessary in this case given her lack of systemic symptoms or abdominal tenderness. MRI would not be indicated as well, given the cost and that an MRI would not change the management of her condition. Increased exercise alone would not adequately address her symptom complex.

Choice A is incorrect because a pelvic ultrasound is not necessary for the management of menstrual cramps in this patient given her presentation.
Choice B is incorrect because an MRI of the pelvis is not indicated in this case.
Choice D is incorrect because, although increased exercise may be beneficial for the patient overall, it does not adequately address her symptom complex.

Predicted Answer: A:  The patient's history of exposure to a rusty nail (a metal object that has been exposed to water and likely contains iron) places her at risk for tetanus infection. Tetanus bacteria can survive on the surface of metals like nails, even when it appears as though they have dried out. Tetanus infection is characterized by muscle rigidity; lockjaw; and a history of exposure to contaminated materials, such as in this case with a rusty nail (tetanus spores may be able to contaminate objects that are not yet wet but could become wet). The ulcers caused by tetanus infections have a characteristic appearance on examination, with the edges being drawn up and the red coloration described in this patient's case. Tetanus bacteria can also cause an infection of the gums (rare) or of bone (osteomyelitis; more likely in this patient's case). Gram stain testing would show gram-positive rods, as seen in choice A.

The mainfactors that determine a need for genetic counselling are thepresence of an index case with a congenital malformation orof genetic disease in the family as well as the presence ofparental
Predicted Answer: A: This question requires you to synthesize a lot of information and use your critical thinking skills. Let's go through this step by step. The patient is asymptomatic; however, he has a family history of an autosomal dominant disease (note the pedigree chart). A mother who is not a carrier cannot have transmitted the disease mutation to her son unless there were other genetic mechanisms involved in this family. Variable expressivity would simply mean that the disease could manifest differently in different people and wouldn't explain why his brother, nephew, and their father are affected and he isn't. Maternal uniparental disomy means that the patient inherited both copies of chromosome 17 from his mother; however, it's very unlikely that the unaffected family members would be carriers or affected if this were true for all family members. Gonadal mosaicism suggests that there is a mixture of cells in the gonads with and without the mutation. Because the mother is not a carrier, you can assume she is free from the disease-causing mutation; however, some gametes that formed his parents could have had the mutation. The patient's father would be unaffected because he would not carry the mutated gene; therefore, only half of the gametes he produced would contain the mutation and half wouldn't. If the patient didn't inherit the diseased-containing gamete, then you wouldn't expect him to express the disease either.

Predicted Answer: A: T-scores are used to describe osteoporosis and osteopenia in postmenopausal women and men over 50 years old. The T-score is calculated by subtracting the mean peak bone mass from the patient’s bone density, and then dividing by the standard deviation of the mean peak bone mass. In this case, a T-score of -1 or higher indicates normal bone density. A T-score between -1 and -2.5 suggests osteopenia, while a T-score of -2.5 or lower suggests osteoporosis. This patient’s T-score is 1.2, indicating that she has no loss of bone mass. (Choice B) The woman in the question has normal bone density because her T-score is higher than –1. A T-score between -1 and –2.5 would indicate osteopenia. Although the results may be confusing, a Z-score should only be used if there are concerns that the patient’s bone mass is not consistent with their age (younger or older). This patient is 68 years old, so her Z-score would not be relevant in this case. (Choice C) A T-score of –0.8 would indicate osteopenia, but it does not best describe this patient’s DEXA scan results.

Haemophilus influenzae requires V-factor (NAD+) and X-factor (hemin) for growth. The medium used must include blood as an added source of these components (CHO = chocolate agar).

Predicted Answer: A: This patient has a classic clinical presentation of Pompe disease characterized by muscle weakness and cardiomegaly in an infant who is unable to sit upright. This disease results from a deficiency in lysosomal acid maltase (also called alpha-glucosidase), the enzyme needed for glycogen breakdown within the lysosome. Therefore, choice C is correct.

Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, choice B, is associated with a similar presentation of fatigue after minimal activity but the patient would have had seizures as well as an abnormal ECG. This enzyme is deficient in long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) disease and very-long-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency, which are both associated with hypoglycemia.

The infundibular septum gives rise to the right ventricular outflow tracts.

Predicted Answer: A: This patient's symptoms of morning stiffness in her fingers that improves as the day progresses, accompanied by joint tenderness and erythema, are most consistent with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), especially given her metacarpophalangeal joints are affected. Synovial fluid analysis would be most helpful for diagnosing RA because it can identify synovitis and potentially detect RA-specific immunoglobulins or crystals; the latter is important in differentiating RA from other causes of arthritis, such as gouty arthritis. Although anti-CCP antibodies (choice B) are a highly specific test for RA, they will not be helpful if this patient's condition turns out to be something else. This decision could delay treatment because patients with undiagnosed or untreated RA experience continued joint damage and disease progression. The rheumatoid factor (choice C), while often elevated in patients with RA, is not as sensitive a marker of RA as anti-CCP antibodies are; moreover, the rheumatoid factor is also present in other inflammatory conditions. An X-ray of the cervical spine (choice D) might be necessary if this patient’s condition turned out to be something like rheumatological neck pain, but it would not help diagnose RA.

Predicted Answer: A: Ewing's sarcoma is a malignant tumor of bone characterized by a dense, well-defined "onion-skin" periosteal reaction visible on radiographs. It typically occurs in children and young adults but can also affect older patients. In this patient, the increased alkaline phosphatase level indicates active bone remodeling associated with neoplastic disease; the widened intercortical space on plain film is consistent with an "onion-skin" appearance of periosteal reaction; and the location and appearance of the lesion (especially as suggested by findings in the image) are most consistent with Ewing's sarcoma. The other options do not account for all laboratory and imaging findings provided.

This organism is associated with the characteristic of being able to form endospores, as it can form a structure that acts similarly to an endospore in its intracellular environment. A is correct.

Let's consider each option:
A: The patient has a 15-pack-year smoking history and fine crackles on exam, which suggests pneumonia. Legionella pneumophila (the organism associated with Legionnaires' disease) can be found in water sources and air conditioning systems, making this the most likely choice.
B: This is incorrect because Legionella pneumophila contains a cell wall.
C: Q fever is caused by Coxiella burnetii , which is an obligate intracellular pathogen that is commonly seen in sheep herders. It does not have any association with parrot owners and would have been ruled out given the patient's history of traveling abroad, drinking socially, and having a smoking history.
D: This is incorrect because Legionella pneumophila can be found in air conditioning systems, but it is transmitted by aerosolized water droplets, not directly by the air conditioning system itself.

Hereditary spherocytosis (A) shows small spherical red cells and Heinz bodies on the peripheral smear. Vitamin B12 deficiency (B) presents with a macrocytic anemia, characterized by large red cells on the peripheral smear. Iron deficiency (C) is a microcytic anemia, which means that the patient's red blood cells are smaller than normal.

Predicted Answer: A) This patient has Parkinson disease given his age, worsening involuntary movements of both arms for the past 7 months, a low-amplitude tremor that worsens when reaching out to grab a pen, difficulty performing daily activities, and a family history of similar symptoms. Parkinson disease is characterized by bradykinesia (a slowness of movement), which was not mentioned but is one of its cardinal features. The best management for this patient would be Levodopa, and carbidopa therapy; however, the most appropriate next step in management for a patient with this condition should involve more than just pharmacologic treatment given its complications. Deep brain stimulation (A) might be considered for patients who have had little benefit from pharmacologic treatments such as levodopa or experience intolerable side effects. Thalamotomy (B) is an older surgical procedure that involves destroying part of the thalamus and is associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline compared to deep brain stimulation.

Predicted Answer: A: The patient in this question has symptoms of a Bartholin's gland cyst. These cysts are usually caused by obstruction of a Bartholin's duct, which can be caused by trauma, infection, or chronic irritation from sexual activity. They typically present as a painless, fluctuant mass on the lateral vulva; however, they can become infected and cause pain, erythema, and edema, similar to the presentation in this question. In such cases, incision and drainage of the cyst is usually necessary to resolve the infection. Answer B is correct.

The other choices are incorrect as follows:

A) While warm sitz baths may help with discomfort and reduce swelling, they would not be effective for treating an infected Bartholin's gland cyst. The most appropriate next step in managing a patient with such symptoms would be incision and drainage of the cyst to relieve pain and promote resolution.

C) A biopsy is indicated when there is suspicion of malignancy, which is not suggested by this presentation.

D) While trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be used as treatment for certain infections (e.g., acute otitis media), it would not be the best choice in this case because an incision and drainage procedure is usually required to treat a Bartholin's gland cyst.

In multiple-choice questions, it may be tempting to choose an answer based upon what sounds correct or based upon general knowledge about a specific topic. However, in doing so you might incorrectly pick the final answer. For example, if one has no clue as to the probability of the patient having cystic fibrosis (choice A), there is no reason to know that choice B is the correct answer and not either C or D, especially since both of these answers sound plausible when compared with the chance of rolling a 6 on a fair die (1/6).

Predicted Answer: A: This question requires knowledge of respiratory physiology. In order to determine which choice best represents the total volume of gas that does not participate in exchange, one must first calculate RV + VC - IRV = 1,000 mL + 5,000 mL - 2,500 mL = 3,500 mL; however, there is an easier way to answer this question: if you add up all of the other lung volumes, you will obtain a value that represents the total volume of air in the lungs. Since RV must be added in order to determine which choice best represents the volume not participating in gas exchange, we can simply subtract the value for RV from the sum calculated above and you will arrive at an answer equal to 3,500 mL - 1,000 mL = 2,500 mL; however, this is not one of our choices. However, you can use a little bit of logic (and knowledge about lung volumes) in order to determine that the correct choice must be B: RV + FRC = 1,000 mL + 2,700 mL = 3,700 mL; however, adding an extra "C" or two will not help. So you need to get rid of a portion of this volume by calculating IRV - (VC - RV) = 2,500 mL - (5,000 mL - 1,000 mL) = 2,500 mL - 4,000 mL = -1,500 mL: You cannot have a negative number. Therefore you need to add the value of VC - RV to IRV in order to make the numbers work: 2,500 mL + (5,000 mL - 1,000 mL) = 6,000 mL - 1,000 mL = 5,000 mL. Now subtract FRC from this value. You should get a number equal to one of the choices below: 6,000 mL - 2,700 mL = 3,300 mL: This is not an answer choice so you will need to do more subtraction in order to obtain an answer that is among your choices. However, before doing any more math be sure that you understand why it works and what would happen if you were to subtract RV or VC from FRC instead of IRV - (VC - RV). If you add the value of RV + VC to each choice listed above, you will find that this is always equal to your calculated answer. This makes sense because both volumes represent the total volume of air in the lungs as well as the dead space and so the sum should be the same. Therefore any subtraction made with RV or VC instead of IRV - (VC - RV) would only serve to make a true statement untrue, which is bad for you as this will result in an answer that does not match any of your choices. The following represents what you would see if you were to subtract each value from 6,000 mL: Choice A: 5,500 mL; choice B: 3,300 mL; choice C: 1,700 mL; choice D: 200 mL. This makes sense because FRC + RV = 2,700 mL + 1,000 mL = 3,700 mL and IRV - (VC - RV) = 2,500 mL - 4,000 mL = -1,500 mL so you would need to subtract a value equal to 3,700 mL or greater from 6,000 mL in order for the math to work. Choices A and B are among your choices and choice C is not as far off either: Choice C: 1,700 mL; FRC + RV - (VC - IRV) = 2,700 mL + 1,000 mL - (5,000 mL - 2,500 mL) = 3,700 mL - 2,500 mL = 1,200 mL. Since you can use the math with any of these volumes to obtain an answer among your choices but choice C is closest in terms of magnitude and choice B would be correct, it is most likely that choice B is the correct answer.

Predicted Answer: A: This woman most likely has pulmonary tuberculosis. The CT scan of her chest probably shows upper lobe infiltrates and/or cavitation. Tuberculosis is a classic cause of chronic weight loss and intermittent fever. Organized epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells without focal necrosis on biopsy are consistent with tuberculous lymphadenitis. Isoniazid (C) is the appropriate choice for treating pulmonary tuberculosis, as it has been shown to be effective in short-course treatment regimens for this condition. A: Incorrect - while cisplatin can be used to treat various types of cancer, there is no indication in this case that a malignant neoplasm exists (such as lymphoma). B: Incorrect - lamivudine is an antiretroviral agent used primarily to prevent or treat HIV-related illnesses such as HIV encephalopathy and HIV wasting syndrome. D: Incorrect - prednisone can be given for treatment of sarcoidosis, another condition that may mimic the findings in this patient. However, the description provided in the case is most consistent with pulmonary tuberculosis.
